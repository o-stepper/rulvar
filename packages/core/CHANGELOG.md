# @lurker/core

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- fa05007: M5-T01 workflow registry and the @lurker/cli base.

  - `@lurker/core` gains the per-engine `WorkflowRegistry` type and
    `defaults.workflows` on createEngine (docs/06 section 10.4): an
    explicit first-class value, no module-level registry; shells resolve
    by-name runs against it (ctx.workflow's string form arrives M6, the
    queue worker M8).
  - Spec-conformance fix: the M4-T09 quality floors option moves from the
    createEngine top level to its canonical home `defaults.roleFloors`
    (docs/06 section 10.1). Update `createEngine({ floors })` call sites
    to `createEngine({ defaults: { roleFloors } })`.
  - `@lurker/cli` ships its first real surface: the canonical grammar
    `lurker run <file|name> [--args JSON] [--store PATH] [--budget-usd N]`,
    `lurker resume <runId> [--args JSON] [--store PATH]`,
    `lurker runs ls [--store PATH]`, `lurker inspect <runId> [--store
PATH]` (no aliases), a line-oriented TUI progress renderer over the
    event stream, and interactive resolution of suspended approvals and
    externals (EOF leaves the run suspended, never errors). Engine
    assembly follows the host-config convention: `lurker.config.mjs`
    default-exports `{ engineOptions?, workflows? }`, a workflow module
    may export `workflow`/`engineOptions`/`workflows`, and --store selects
    the JsonlFileStore directory (default `.lurker`), so the CLI itself
    depends only on @lurker/core. The `lurker` bin is included; the
    resume/inspect grammar amendment (--args re-supply, --store symmetry)
    is recorded in docs/06 section 10.5.

- 9234dc8: M5-T03 cost reports. The CostReport builder moves to its own module
  (`engine/cost-report.ts`) and report totals become the LEDGER FOLD
  totals at settle: RunOutcome.usage and cost.totalUsd are computed from
  the journal's terminal entries (the same summation the kernel budget
  seed uses), so report totals equal ledger fold totals exactly, live and
  across resume, by construction. The new `costReportFromJournal(entries,
priceUsd)` is the pure fold for STORED runs: byModel and totals from
  terminal servedBy with abandoned subtrees contributing zero; phase,
  agentType, and role attribution are live-run facts that entries do not
  carry (byRole and the orchestrator block complete in M7 per DEF-7).
  Unpriced models keep surfacing, never as silent zeros. `lurker inspect`
  gains the cost view (total, byModel, unpriced) over the config-assembled
  price function (table wins over caps.pricing), and live run output
  prints the byModel/byPhase buckets.
- 644512c: M5-T05 permission presets, audit, dry-run and M5-T06 argv shell matcher.

  - `compilePermissionPreset('strict' | 'standard' | 'open')`
    (`tools/presets.ts`) compiles the shipped presets to the documented
    verdict-by-risk tables and folds INTO the existing deny/ask chain
    layers, after host-authored rules, never a fifth layer and never an
    allow-override (a needsApproval tool still asks under every preset).
    `open` compiles to empty tables. `AgentProfilePermissions.preset` now
    compiles instead of throwing; undeclared tool risk is matched
    conservatively via a first-class `{ risk: 'undeclared' }` rule.
  - The argv shell matcher (`tools/shell-matcher.ts`) replaces the M5
    fail-early stub for `{ tool, argv }` rules: a POSIX-like lexer honors
    quotes and escapes with no expansion, splits on `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|`/`&`/
    newline, poisons segments containing command or process substitution
    or here-docs to ask, strips leading env assignments, and retains
    redirections as tokens. Verdicts compose strictest-across-segments, so
    `npm test; rm -rf /` yields deny (or ask) even with `npm test`
    allow-listed, and any unmatched segment yields ask.
  - `evaluatePermission` gains an offline overload (by tool name, no
    execution) for the docs/08 4.5 dry-run/shell-tooling API, and every
    verdict carries the audit payload (verdict, deciding layer, matched
    rule) that now rides `tool:end` events; advisory network-domain rules
    are reported there but never enforced outside first-party fetch
    (honest posture, docs/08 4.4).

- 8a41656: M5-T07 RunProfile presets and M5-T08 OTel exporter.

  - `engine/run-profiles.ts`: `RUN_PROFILES` (fast/standard/deep/ultra) and
    `runProfile(name)` ship the presets as pure DATA, bundles of per-role
    effort hints, per-run concurrency, budget, permission preset, and
    spawn limits, with no functions and no named model strings (named
    strong defaults stay in the umbrella). They are never engine
    semantics: a source-scan test asserts the engine has zero branches
    keyed on profile names. `lurker run --profile <name>` applies the
    chosen profile UNDER the host's own engine options (host always wins;
    the engine then sees only ordinary options), compiling the profile's
    permission preset into the engine deny/ask layers as data.
  - `@lurker/cli` gains `toOtel(run, tracer)`: it maps a settled run's
    spanId tree 1:1 onto OpenTelemetry spans (run > phase > agent > tool >
    child), with lurker.* and gen_ai.* attributes, start/end timestamps
    from the lifecycle events, and payload-only events attached as span
    events. Prompts, completions, and tool payloads are NEVER exported;
    replayed events never create duplicate spans. `@opentelemetry/api`
    ^1.9 is an optional peer dependency and the exporter is typed against
    a minimal structural TracerLike, so an absent OTel package never
    breaks the CLI.

### Patch Changes

- 02f7f7a: M5-T09 examples corpus. A new (unpublished) `examples/` vitest project
  ships runnable reference implementations of the documented quality
  patterns as recipes over the public `ctx` API, never engine flags:
  adversarial panel (N independent skeptics prompted to refute; majority
  survives), judge panel (N angled attempts each scored; top wins),
  loop-until-dry (keep finding until K consecutive empty rounds), and
  completeness critic (draft, then gap-driven revision passes). Each
  example is a real `defineWorkflow` and doubles as an integration test
  under FakeAdapter with zero live calls, so an example that stops
  compiling fails CI like any test. The corpus is registered in the
  pnpm workspace and the single Vitest project set; the umbrella marker
  package is unchanged (patch to carry the changeset).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ac274f4: M4-T01 role protocol completion. The full trigger protocol for the six
  invocation roles lands in `@lurker/core` (`model/roles.ts`):

  - Extract necessity is completed per docs/04 section 8.3: a separate
    final structured-output invocation fires when a schema is set AND
    (routing directs extract to a different model OR the loop model's
    required tier cannot ride a tools-available turn OR finalize is
    routed). The required-tier rule is new: a `forced-tool` tier pins
    toolChoice to `emit_result` and cannot ride while the agent's tools
    must remain available, so such agents now pay one separate extract
    call instead of silently losing tool access. Agents without tools
    keep the M1 single-shot behavior byte for byte.
  - The finalize role fires for the first time: only when configured in
    routing and only for tool-bearing agents, as one synthesis invocation
    with toolChoice `'none'` over the full transcript after tools stop.
    Its text is the output for schema-less calls; with a schema the
    separate extract runs over the transcript including the synthesis.
  - A separate extract invocation over a tool-bearing transcript now
    carries the agent's tool contracts (both providers reject tool-use
    history without tool definitions) with toolChoice pinned to `'none'`
    or to `emit_result` per tier.
  - Both adapters map `toolChoice: 'none'` to the provider's explicit
    none choice with the tools param present instead of dropping tools
    from the request.
  - `createTestEngine` no longer routes `finalize` by default: the
    routing key is the firing opt-in, and the old default would have
    summoned a synthesis call for every tool-bearing test agent. Tests
    that want finalize route it explicitly.

  Identity is untouched: extract and finalize resolutions never enter
  the spawn content key, and existing journals replay unchanged.

- 5735d92: M4-T02 HistoryProjector. Cross-provider history projection lands in
  `@lurker/core` (`model/projector.ts`) and the retention pipeline that
  feeds it:

  - `projectHistory` projects the canonical history into a target
    provider's view: provider-raw parts ride if and only if the target
    adapter's provider family matches the part's provider; everything
    else passes through untouched. The agent loop projects EVERY outgoing
    request (loop turns, finalize, extract), so per-role provider mixing
    inside one agent yields a valid wire history on each side.
  - Retention transport: adapters ship a turn's blocks-to-retain in
    stream order via `finish.providerMetadata[<adapter id>].retainedParts`;
    the runtime lifts them into provider-raw parts at the HEAD of the
    turn's canonical assistant message. `@lurker/anthropic` ships thinking
    and redacted_thinking blocks (signatures intact, pause_turn
    continuations included); `@lurker/openai` ships reasoning items with
    their encrypted_content. Retained blocks now actually reach the
    canonical history, survive checkpoints, and echo byte-exact to their
    own provider on every subsequent turn.
  - `ProviderAdapter` gains an optional `provider` field: the provider
    family for provider-raw matching (default = adapter id). The
    first-class adapters declare 'anthropic' and 'openai';
    `openaiCompatible` gateways declare 'openai' whatever their custom id,
    so same-family adapters share retained blocks and projections.

  Identity is untouched: projection state never enters content keys, and
  adapters that ship no retention payload (FakeAdapter included) produce
  byte-identical histories.

- 46ca98e: M4-T03 compaction ownership. The Agent Runtime owns compaction
  (`runtime/compaction.ts`):

  - Compaction is ON by default for every agent at threshold 0.8 of the
    loop model's contextWindow (docs/06 Appendix A);
    `AgentProfile.compaction.threshold` adjusts it per profile. The
    context estimate is the last loop turn's inputTokens + outputTokens.
  - At a tool turn boundary past the threshold the summarize role fires
    through the resolution chain (falling back to the loop model when
    routing resolves no summarize model; the low role-effort default
    applies either way), and the transcript after the first message is
    replaced by one user-role summary message. The summarize request is
    projected like any other and carries the tool contracts with
    toolChoice 'none'.
  - Compaction points (the turn numbers at which compaction fired) ride
    every checkpoint and restore verbatim: a resumed run continues from
    the compacted history and never re-summarizes it. Full-journal replay
    stays free as before.
  - A failed or empty summarize disables compaction for the rest of the
    run with a warning instead of failing paid work; budget and
    cancellation aborts propagate normally.

- 8ae129e: M4-T04 failover and M4-T05 RetryPolicy under the journal.

  - Transport RetryPolicy (`model/retry.ts`): the Appendix A defaults
    (attempts 3; backoff 500ms x2 max 8000ms with equal jitter; retryOn
    transport, rate-limit, overloaded) now actually retry around every
    adapter.stream dispatch: loop turns, extract, finalize, and summarize
    alike. Retries live UNDER the journal: a retried-then-successful call
    is one journal entry with one usage total, one turn, and no lineage
    attempts (DEF-3). A provider retryAfterMs replaces the computed
    delay; task-class failures never retry by construction; stream-idle
    severance retries as transport-class. Configure per call
    (`AgentOpts.retry`), per profile, or engine-wide
    (`defaults.retry`).
  - Transport failover (`model/failover.ts`): `ModelChoice.fallbacks`
    now works. When a serving model exhausts its tries on a transport or
    rate-limit failure, the sticky chain advances to the next resolved
    fallback (per-phase, effort defaults and caps scrubbing re-applied
    per serving model). The content key hashes the REQUESTED spec, so a
    failover-served response replays for free; only `servedBy` records
    the actual server (now surfaced on AgentResult and stamped on the
    terminal entry). Budget is explicitly excluded as a trigger.
  - The degenerate fallback field (`AgentOpts.fallback`, docs/04 11.3):
    an agent-level second attempt on a stronger model when the terminal
    matches `on` (error, limit, schema-exhausted), with exactly one
    journaled decision entry (`decisionType: 'model.fallback'`) reused on
    resume, and the fallback attempt under its own content key. Cancelled,
    escalated, and budget outcomes never trigger it.

  `AgentResult` gains the required `servedBy` field (additive for
  consumers reading results; literal constructions in tests need the new
  member).

- d1c4525: M4-T06 versioned price table and M4-T07 per-provider concurrency keys.

  - `model/pricing.ts`: `PriceTable { pricingVersion, models }` configured
    via `createEngine({ pricing })`. The table wins over adapter-reported
    `caps.pricing` (a fallback only); unpriced models keep surfacing in
    CostReport, never as a silent zero. Engine-written `model.fallback`
    decision entries pin the active `pricingVersion` so replayed cost
    attribution is stable against later table bumps; a price update is a
    registry update with a version bump, never a caps refresh side effect
    (`refreshCaps()` remains the adapter-level caps path).
  - `model/concurrency.ts`: `KeyedLimiter`, engine-scoped, configured via
    `createEngine({ concurrency: { perProvider } })` per adapter id. The
    Appendix A default stays unlimited: the per-run semaphore remains the
    only default bound and provider 429s ride RetryPolicy. When
    configured, every wire dispatch (retries and failover re-acquire)
    gates under its serving adapter's key, adapters throttle
    independently, and queueing surfaces as agent:queued telemetry with
    the provider key. There is deliberately no distributed cross-process
    limiter (docs/14).

- b840aba: M4-T08 canonical effort completion and M4-T09 role quality floors.

  - Effort semantics are complete: the role effort defaults and the
    per-adapter mapping tables (Anthropic passthrough including max,
    OpenAI max downmapped to xhigh and recorded in providerMetadata,
    provider none only via namespaced providerOptions) shipped earlier
    milestones; this change completes VISIBLE scrubbing everywhere it was
    still silent: the summarize invocation surfaces its scrubs at fire
    time and a failover takeover surfaces the fallback's scrubs the
    moment it starts serving. Scrubbed effort is never mapped into
    max_tokens.
  - The effort-defaults-shift cassette is now RECORDED through the live
    runtime (docs/10 M4 gating row): the frozen v1 prefix, closed offline
    the way an operator would, resumes live under explicit high effort
    with the completed semantics; every v1 entry matches and the one new
    spawn carries canonical effort in v2 identity. The recorder output is
    pinned byte-for-byte by the frozen-drift suite and the fixture lock
    now covers 18 files.
  - Quality floors (`model/floors.ts`, M4-T09): per-role and
    per-declared-taskClass allow/deny lists supplied via
    `createEngine({ floors })`, enforced INSIDE the router at resolution,
    before any live call and before any journal entry, for every
    invocation the chain produces (primaries, failover fallbacks, and the
    summarize fallback alike). `AgentProfile.taskClass` declares the
    class; unclassified profiles see only byRole floors. A violation is a
    typed ConfigError.
  - The umbrella `lurker` package now ships floors opinions next to its
    strong routing defaults: `recommendedDefaults.floors` pins orchestrate
    and plan to strong named models. The core itself ships no named model
    strings, and the umbrella suite enforces that with a source scan.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dfe03b5: M3-T11 gating cassettes and the v0.4.0 BREAKING release notes.

  BREAKING (pre-1.0 convention, docs/12): `AgentStatus` now produces
  `'escalated'` at runtime and `AgentResult` carries the optional
  `escalation: EscalationReport` field (present if and only if the status
  is escalated). This is the third kernel amendment of the replay
  predicate (escalated-replays-as-ok, DEF-1) whose table row shipped
  frozen in M2; the producers ship here. Migration: add an `escalated`
  branch to every switch over `AgentStatus`; consumers not adopting the
  protocol are advised to map `escalated` to `limit` (paid partial work,
  output null, the report stays available for logs). `isEscalated` and
  `EscalatedResult` are exported for narrowing. Status production stays
  gated by opt-in: workflows that never pass `escalation` options cannot
  observe the new status at runtime.

  Cassettes: the DEF-1 live set (escalate-replay,
  crash-between-report-and-decision, flavor-b-timeout) is recorded through
  the live runtime and replayed strict; the M2 synthetic DEF-1 subset is
  re-recorded (memoize-classifier fully live; abandon-subtree through the
  kernel write APIs with a realistic escalated child report and an
  authorizing owner cancel decision; both re-record again with the
  orchestrator producers in M7). FakeAdapter gains fakeToolCalls and
  fakeWireError responder markers; replayRun gains the onEscalation
  pass-through so replay tests can prove the hook stays cold. The
  deliberate fixture regeneration updates fixtures.sha256 in the same
  change (the identity profile is UNCHANGED; this is the docs/10 M3-T11
  ordered re-record, not an identity-pipeline revision).

- d2089a7: M3-T02 turn-boundary checkpoints. The runtime writes a canonical-history
  checkpoint into TranscriptStore at every turn boundary where the loop
  continues (tool boundaries and schema re-prompts), at a deterministic ref
  derived from the dispatch seq; the terminal entry records checkpointRef.
  A dangling-dispatch resume (kill-and-resume) re-enters at the last
  boundary with zero re-paid turns, restored usage folds into the terminal
  exactly once, and an unreadable or unknown-format blob falls back to a
  full redispatch (tools stay at-least-once between execution and the
  checkpoint write). The blob format is engine-internal with a leading
  format byte; replayed agents recover their turn count from the checkpoint
  and re-emit tool:start/tool:end with the replay marker.
- 3f60234: M3-T07 terminal escalated status and EscalationProtocol producers (the
  BREAKING section for v0.4.0 rides the milestone release notes). Typed
  EscalationKind/EscalationReport/EscalationDecision/EscalationOptions;
  the escalate tool registers under escalation opt-in of either flavor
  through the same path as any tool (opting in changes toolsetHash by
  design) and is engine-intercepted after the permission chain. Status
  production is gated: without opt-in the escalate tool does not exist and
  'escalated' is physically unproducible. Flavor A terminates the worker
  with a runtime-completed report (costToDate and salvage are never
  model-authored; the request schema rejects them; the full report is
  validated BEFORE append; usage/costUsd/turns/transcriptRef as for ok,
  output null). Flavor B suspends on the approval machinery with a
  journaled deadlineAt (explicit deadlineMs required); a live decision and
  the deadline timer race through the ResolutionArbiter first-closing-wins
  (timeout applies defaultDecision, default accept); dispose collects the
  worktree patch into salvage BEFORE destruction; the terminal escalated
  entry and the authoritative escalation-decision entry follow strictly
  after, with countsAgainstLimit derived once (true iff scope_bigger).
  Replays synthesize the byte-identical report with zero adapter calls and
  read the owner's decision from the decision entry (a crash between
  report and decision pays the decision live exactly once). In ctx.parallel
  an escalated child is a settled outcome that never aborts siblings; a
  plain value-form call opting in requires the onEscalation hook
  (ConfigError before any LLM call otherwise). The in-run minSpend gate
  (M3-T09) rejects early scope_bigger escalations with a bounded "keep
  working" re-prompt; scope_different and blocked_with_evidence are
  exempt and never debit the counter.
- f668890: M3-T05 worktree isolation and M3-T06 openaiCompatible. GitWorktreeProvider
  implements the IsolationProvider seam: acquire creates a detached
  worktree from HEAD or a given ref (non-git host is a typed ConfigError),
  tools receive cwd inside the tree, collect() snapshots changed files and
  a binary patch, dispose removes the tree with keepOnError retention
  under the shared maxPinnedWorktrees cap (default 4). ctx.agent resolves
  isolation call-over-profile into spawn identity, stores the collected
  patch in TranscriptStore, and surfaces it as a kind 'patch' Artifact on
  AgentResult.artifacts and the terminal journal entry, so replays
  reconstruct artifacts with zero live calls; applying the patch stays
  with the caller. isolation 'readonly' is accepted as a declaration (its
  compiled deny rule ships with risk presets in M5).

  @lurker/openai gains openaiCompatible({ id, baseURL, apiKey?, caps? })
  for Ollama, vLLM, and gateways: the Chat Completions dialect by
  construction, explicit ids so several endpoints coexist (duplicate id
  stays a ConfigError at createEngine), and the most conservative caps
  when unprobed (prompt-tier structured output, no parallel tools, no
  pricing; supplied caps merge over the floor).

- 16d7aa6: M3-T04 MCP ToolSource. `mcp(cfg)` imports Model Context Protocol tools
  over stdio, streamable-http, or an in-process server instance (pinned
  SDK line @modelcontextprotocol/sdk ^1.29; the v2 migration is the
  logged post-M3 task M5-T10). tools/list is fetched with cursor
  pagination until exhaustion and cached per session; a listChanged
  notification invalidates the cache for subsequently spawned agents only
  (a spawn's toolset snapshot stays immutable). allow/deny filters apply
  to pre-prefix names with deny winning; `prefix` namespaces collisions;
  `approval` maps to needsApproval per tool; host-supplied `risk` labels
  feed the permission presets. inputSchema becomes bare-JSON-Schema
  parameters (form 3); outputSchema validates structuredContent;
  isError maps to an error tool result surfaced to the model, never a
  protocol error; MCP tools hash version as absent, so provider-side
  contract drift re-keys new spawns by design.
- 6513ce8: M3-T08 no-progress abort class and M3-T10 UsageLimits completion. The
  engine-defined detector implements the committed docs/06 Appendix A
  interim rule (N consecutive turns without tool calls or artifact deltas,
  N = 3, configurable via the new UsageLimits.noProgressTurns knob): the
  abort journals as the agent's terminal entry with status 'limit', the
  dedicated 'no-progress' class marker in the error payload
  (AgentResult.abortClass), and memoizeOutcome stamped by the ENGINE on
  the terminal entry, so it replays on every resume without a live rerun
  regardless of the user's dispatch-time memoize policy (the predicate's
  entry-read consults the terminal stamp first; docs/03 section 6.6
  amendment). Tool-calling turns reset the streak: a working agent never
  trips. UsageLimits is complete: maxTurns, maxToolCalls,
  maxOutputTokensPerTurn, timeoutMs, streamIdleTimeoutMs, noProgressTurns,
  and the run-level deadline each independently produce their documented
  outcome, with per-limit tests including the memoized-limit
  replay/unmemoized rerun predicate integration. The M3-T09 minSpend gate
  gains the accumulation path test (scope_bigger passes once spend crosses
  minSpendUsd).
- 7dad493: M3-T03 permission chain and ask suspensions. The normative layered chain
  (hooks -> deny rules -> ask rules -> canUseTool -> terminal default) is
  the single approval surface for every tool dispatch; hooks run in
  deterministic registration order with modifiedInput substitution; rules
  never yield allow; an explicit canUseTool allow is decisive including
  over needsApproval; argv/domain rules and presets fail early until M5.
  Engine-wide defaults.permissions merges under profile permissions;
  inheritPermissions is carried as data for subagent spawning (mode c).
  An ask verdict journals a suspended approval entry (kind 'approval',
  identity {toolName, post-hook input}, agent child scope) together with
  the turn checkpoint; the run settles 'suspended' with the synthesized
  approval:<seq> key; RunHandle.resolveExternal validates
  { decision: 'allow' | 'deny' } and a denial surfaces to the model as an
  error tool result carrying the reason. An approval round-trip across
  process exit resumes the SAME turn: executed tool results are reused
  from the checkpoint, the resolved decision applies without
  re-suspension, and only post-approval turns are paid live.
- 2bbf180: M3-T01 tool system core plus the M3 entry-gate docs amendment. `tool()`
  definitions over the three SchemaSpec forms with definition-time
  validation (name pattern, schema projection, recursive/remote ref
  rejection); the ToolSource SPI seam types (ToolDef, ToolRisk, ToolContext,
  ToolSourceSession); per-spawn toolset resolution with duplicate-name and
  executor fail-early ConfigErrors; toolsetHash derived from contracts only
  (editing an execute body never re-keys a journal, bumping `version` does)
  and wired into spawn identity; agent-loop tool dispatch with argument
  validation, bounded ModelRetry conversion, NonSerializableValueError
  surfacing, maxToolCalls expiry as terminal `limit`, and tool:start /
  tool:end telemetry. The docs/06 Appendix A knob "no-progress detector N"
  is committed at 3 consecutive turns without tool calls or artifact deltas
  (consumed by M3-T08).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 43444f6: M2-T11/T12: the executable store conformance kit and the M2 gating
  cassettes with frozen fixtures.

  @lurker/store-conformance ships its first real API: journalStoreConformance
  (A1 append atomicity, A2 total per-run order, A3 read-your-writes, A4
  opaque payload with read-side-only normalization, meta separation, the
  golden fold-state fixture with a frozen reference hash, the decide-once
  oracle, and the abandon-derived-skip fixture) and leasableStoreConformance
  (typed LeaseHeldError on held acquire, monotonic fencing epochs,
  stale-epoch appends rejected and invisible, released leases fenced from
  renew and append, optional ttl/renew-cadence timing checks), plus
  registerConformance for Vitest/Jest and the stableStringify fold-state
  hasher. InMemoryStore and JsonlFileStore pass; deliberately broken stores
  (reordering, normalizing, tearing, fencing-less) fail loudly.

  @lurker/core kernel closes three DEF-1/DEF-4 gaps the cassettes gate: an
  abandon-covered hanging dispatch derives skipped instead of redispatching,
  abandon-covered operations contribute a zero ledger increment, the resume
  report lists covered entries as skipped (never orphaned), and an abandon
  over an already-resolved suspension folds to a noop with already_resolved
  (first-closing-wins per target, both closer kinds).

  @lurker/testing ships the M2 cassette suite over committed frozen
  fixtures: the DEF-1 synthetic subset (abandon-subtree, memoize-classifier,
  v1-journal-on-v2), the DEF-4 set (timeout-vs-live-race,
  class-decision-fanout, abandon-then-crash-then-resume,
  abandon-vs-resolution-race, offline-invalid-then-valid,
  double-abandon-idempotent), the DEF-6 six IDs (resume-v1-on-engine-v2,
  resume-v1-with-inserted-call, suspended-v1-resolves-on-v2,
  reject-version-too-old via deriverV0Synthetic, reject-version-from-future,
  effort-defaults-shift), the mandatory mixed-version scenarios
  (ordinal-space split, forward-cursor preference, cross-version
  resolution, the compatibility and never-pay-twice-through-upgrade
  lemmas), and KeyDeriver contract tests against the frozen v2 golden
  identities including the docs/03 worked example. Fixture regeneration is
  deliberate: scripts/record-m2-cassettes.mjs rebuilds, and CI write
  protection (scripts/check-frozen-fixtures.mjs plus fixtures.sha256)
  fails any fixture diff shipped without the explicit bump token (the
  hyphenated compound of hashVersion and bump) in a changeset.

- 279881b: M2-T05/T06: the hashVersion mechanism and the canonical replay predicate.
  Frozen KeyDeriver profiles (v2 current; v1 with the effort-stripping
  projection, round-1 disposition table, and foldDefaults), the per-engine
  deriver registry with extraDerivers validation as the only window
  extender, the side-effect-free compatibility scan raising
  JournalCompatibilityError with sub-codes and hints, versioned matching
  through the registry KeyRing (live calls projected DOWN, incomparable is
  a guaranteed non-match, keys memoized per call and version); the single
  canonical replayDisposition with the three kernel amendments
  (memoizeOutcome on task-class failures via classifyAgentError,
  abandon-derived skipped through the append-order AbandonFold with
  transitive child-scope coverage, escalated-replays-as-ok), version
  dispatch by the entry's own profile, and the invalidate/retry unpinning
  API. @lurker/compat ships the extraDerivers plumbing plus the synthetic
  hashVersion 0 deriver (manually versioned 0.1.0 per the lockstep
  exemption).
- 9fd0966: M2-T03/T04: scoped forward-matching and the kinds/grammar freeze. The
  JournalMatcher (per-scope insertion-stable cursors, first unconsumed
  match wins, cache/never per-call modes, orphan reporting) integrated into
  the Replayer with seeded seq/ordinal spaces and the resume ledger fold;
  ctx.agent/step/now/random/uuid replay journaled results byte-identically
  with zero adapter calls, dangling running entries redispatch with the
  terminal referencing the original dispatch, and replayed lifecycle events
  carry replayed: true. Kinds registry v2 payload validators enforce the
  docs/03 shapes on engine-written entries; the scope grammar gains a
  parser with round-trip guarantees. The interim disposition is round-1;
  the full DEF-1 table plugs in with M2-T06.
- 24ebadf: M2-T07/T08: suspension machinery (DEF-4). Strict ResolutionPayload and
  AbandonPayload with the normative by-source mapping; the
  first-closing-wins ResolutionFold (schema validation at consumption
  against the schema pinned inside the suspended entry, invalid offline
  resolutions never close, abandon coverage with transitive child
  scope-prefix and the AbandonFold projection consumed by the replay
  predicate); the per-target FIFO ResolutionArbiter (classify, durable
  append, settle exactly once; losing attempts are journaled noops); rule
  O2 hard errors on forward or dangling refs; Replayer
  resolveSuspended/abandonBranch/suspensionState; ctx.awaitExternal (NO
  deadline in v1, duplicate key in scope is a typed error) with run
  outcome 'suspended' plus pending[] on quiescence; and
  RunHandle.resolveExternal returning ResolutionOutcome, validating live
  payloads BEFORE append and journaling nothing on InvalidResolutionError.
- a1b35d3: M2-T09/T10: engine.resume under the run-to-definition binding contract
  (wf required for in-process runs, name mismatch is a typed ConfigError,
  body-hash mismatch warns loudly and proceeds; the compatibility scan
  runs strictly before any side effect; the resumed run seeds the budget
  from the ledger fold, re-emits open suspensions, and reports
  ResumePreview hits/misses/reruns/orphans plus invalid offline
  resolutions), the dryRun option (replay-strict matching: the first
  would-be-live call settles the run with the typed journal_miss error and
  zero live calls), and @lurker/testing replayRun (tier 3: strict replay
  of any journal with JournalMissError on ANY live call; suspended
  journals finish suspended with zero live calls).
- 18a5821: M2-T01/T02 groundwork: JsonlFileStore (one JSON entry per line, the
  journal doubles as an event log; torn-trailing-line tolerance and repair
  for A1 atomicity; atomic temp-plus-rename meta replace; listRuns without
  payload parsing; mid-file corruption is a hard JournalOrderViolation) and
  the committed large-value soft warn threshold (262144 bytes, docs/06
  Appendix A M2 entry gate) wired into the journal append path as a
  warning event, never an error.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c24228d: M1-T10/T11: the WorkflowEvent envelope and M1 catalog (per-run telemetry
  seq distinct from JournalEntry.seq, span hierarchy run > phase > agent),
  the per-run EventBus feeding RunHandle.events and on(), RunOutcome with
  exhausted-overrides-error precedence and the normative CostReport
  (byModel/byPhase/byAgentType/byRole, the all-zero orchestrator block,
  unpriced evidence); createEngine with per-engine registries and
  engine.run over the ScriptRunner seam; InProcessRunner with the dev-mode
  bare-Date.now/Math.random warnings; run cancellation (host signal,
  handle.cancel, run deadline) and RunMeta run-to-definition binding
  fields. The umbrella ships the minimal terminal progress renderer
  (renderProgress) and re-exports the core surface.
- c50871e: M1-T04/T05: journal write path and model router core. JournalEntry form
  with the kinds registry v2 and hashVersion (written as 2 from day one),
  IdentityInput records per spawn kind with content-key derivation (sha256
  over RFC 8785 JCS; reproduces the docs/03 worked example byte-identically),
  the scope-path grammar, ordinal assignment, the per-run serialized append
  queue with the JSON-serializability check, the budget-ledger fold,
  JournalStore/LeasableStore/TranscriptStore SPI types, InMemoryStore (loud
  one-time resume-disabled warning) and InMemoryTranscriptStore; the
  per-engine adapter registry (duplicate adapterId is a ConfigError), strict
  ModelRef parsing, the per-invocation resolution chain with role effort
  defaults, CanonicalModelSpec canonicalization, visible caps scrubbing
  (effort and sampling parameters), and structured-output tier selection
  with the strict-compatibility predicate.
- 1af8fb9: M1-T01/T02/T03: L0 foundations. Wire contracts (Msg/Part with provider-raw,
  ChatRequest, the ChatEvent union with typed refusal finish outcomes, the
  Usage invariant, CanonicalId minting, cacheHint, canonical five-level
  Effort, the ModelSpec family declarations); the closed error taxonomy
  (LurkerError base, WireError projection, all named error classes, the
  AgentError value projection); SchemaSpec in its three forms with Out<S>
  inference, StandardJSONSchemaV1 projection (draft 2020-12 with draft-07
  fallback), canonical schema derivation (JCS, local $ref inlining,
  annotation stripping), schemaHash/toolsetHash, and runtime validation via
  the vendored draft 2020-12 validator.
- 1fe0249: M1-T06/T07/T08/T09: agent runtime v1 (single subagent loop, structured
  output in three tiers with client validation and the bounded re-prompt,
  typed AgentResult with the ok/error/limit/cancelled/skipped vocabulary,
  ModelRetry declaration, UsageLimits with the normative merge and defaults,
  typed refusal handling, Usage-invariant verification at the adapter
  boundary); ctx primitives (defineWorkflow with the errorPolicy literal
  generic, ctx.agent overloads including result: 'full', ctx.parallel with
  Settled and abortSiblings semantics, ctx.pipeline with up to six stages
  and onItemError drop/throw/collect, ctx.step with useMemo-style deps
  keying, ctx.phase cost attribution, ctx.log, ctx.budget, and the
  deterministic now/random/uuid shims journaled as rand entries); the
  per-run FIFO semaphore scheduler; and the three-layer budget (admission
  reserves, the per-turn guard, the AbortSignal ceiling with usageApprox,
  immutable B0, BudgetExhaustedError thrown uniformly by every ctx
  primitive, run.dropped evidence for every silent loss).
- 5c4fc32: M1-T14/T15: @lurker/testing tier 1 (FakeAdapter matching on
  agentType/label/prompt regex with a '*' fallback, honoring the selected
  structured-output tier, zero USD by construction; createTestEngine over
  the full real engine with recorded event streams; toHaveCalledAgent and
  toStayUnderBudget matchers at '@lurker/testing/matchers') and the
  completed umbrella (re-exports of @lurker/core and both first-class
  adapters, renderProgress, the umbrella-only recommendedDefaults strong
  model slots, the M1 exit-criteria example workflow, and the CI install
  smoke on packed tarballs). The core now populates the reserved
  providerOptions 'lurker' telemetry namespace on every request (docs/04
  section 1.8 as amended) and AgentResult carries errorMessage detail for
  journaled WireError fidelity.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f4e2be9: M0 repo bootstrap (v0.1.0, docs/10-implementation-plan.md section "M0"):
  monorepo scaffold on the committed toolchain (pnpm 11 workspaces with
  catalogs, TypeScript 6.0, tsdown, Vitest 4, ESLint 9 flat config,
  Turborepo 2, changesets fixed mode, npm trusted publishing), the docs/
  canon as single source of truth, the L0 contracts skeleton in @lurker/core,
  and the vendored dependencies (StandardSchemaV1/StandardJSONSchemaV1 types,
  the @cfworker/json-schema lineage validator subset, a first-party monotonic
  ULID). Placeholder scaffolds only: no public API ships in this release.
