# @lurker/lurker

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b840aba: M4-T08 canonical effort completion and M4-T09 role quality floors.

  - Effort semantics are complete: the role effort defaults and the
    per-adapter mapping tables (Anthropic passthrough including max,
    OpenAI max downmapped to xhigh and recorded in providerMetadata,
    provider none only via namespaced providerOptions) shipped earlier
    milestones; this change completes VISIBLE scrubbing everywhere it was
    still silent: the summarize invocation surfaces its scrubs at fire
    time and a failover takeover surfaces the fallback's scrubs the
    moment it starts serving. Scrubbed effort is never mapped into
    max_tokens.
  - The effort-defaults-shift cassette is now RECORDED through the live
    runtime (docs/10 M4 gating row): the frozen v1 prefix, closed offline
    the way an operator would, resumes live under explicit high effort
    with the completed semantics; every v1 entry matches and the one new
    spawn carries canonical effort in v2 identity. The recorder output is
    pinned byte-for-byte by the frozen-drift suite and the fixture lock
    now covers 18 files.
  - Quality floors (`model/floors.ts`, M4-T09): per-role and
    per-declared-taskClass allow/deny lists supplied via
    `createEngine({ floors })`, enforced INSIDE the router at resolution,
    before any live call and before any journal entry, for every
    invocation the chain produces (primaries, failover fallbacks, and the
    summarize fallback alike). `AgentProfile.taskClass` declares the
    class; unclassified profiles see only byRole floors. A violation is a
    typed ConfigError.
  - The umbrella `lurker` package now ships floors opinions next to its
    strong routing defaults: `recommendedDefaults.floors` pins orchestrate
    and plan to strong named models. The core itself ships no named model
    strings, and the umbrella suite enforces that with a source scan.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c24228d: M1-T10/T11: the WorkflowEvent envelope and M1 catalog (per-run telemetry
  seq distinct from JournalEntry.seq, span hierarchy run > phase > agent),
  the per-run EventBus feeding RunHandle.events and on(), RunOutcome with
  exhausted-overrides-error precedence and the normative CostReport
  (byModel/byPhase/byAgentType/byRole, the all-zero orchestrator block,
  unpriced evidence); createEngine with per-engine registries and
  engine.run over the ScriptRunner seam; InProcessRunner with the dev-mode
  bare-Date.now/Math.random warnings; run cancellation (host signal,
  handle.cancel, run deadline) and RunMeta run-to-definition binding
  fields. The umbrella ships the minimal terminal progress renderer
  (renderProgress) and re-exports the core surface.
- 5c4fc32: M1-T14/T15: @lurker/testing tier 1 (FakeAdapter matching on
  agentType/label/prompt regex with a '*' fallback, honoring the selected
  structured-output tier, zero USD by construction; createTestEngine over
  the full real engine with recorded event streams; toHaveCalledAgent and
  toStayUnderBudget matchers at '@lurker/testing/matchers') and the
  completed umbrella (re-exports of @lurker/core and both first-class
  adapters, renderProgress, the umbrella-only recommendedDefaults strong
  model slots, the M1 exit-criteria example workflow, and the CI install
  smoke on packed tarballs). The core now populates the reserved
  providerOptions 'lurker' telemetry namespace on every request (docs/04
  section 1.8 as amended) and AgentResult carries errorMessage detail for
  journaled WireError fidelity.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f4e2be9: M0 repo bootstrap (v0.1.0, docs/10-implementation-plan.md section "M0"):
  monorepo scaffold on the committed toolchain (pnpm 11 workspaces with
  catalogs, TypeScript 6.0, tsdown, Vitest 4, ESLint 9 flat config,
  Turborepo 2, changesets fixed mode, npm trusted publishing), the docs/
  canon as single source of truth, the L0 contracts skeleton in @lurker/core,
  and the vendored dependencies (StandardSchemaV1/StandardJSONSchemaV1 types,
  the @cfworker/json-schema lineage validator subset, a first-party monotonic
  ULID). Placeholder scaffolds only: no public API ships in this release.
