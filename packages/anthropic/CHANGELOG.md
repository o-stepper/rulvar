### Minor Changes

- 7577f8e: Correct the Anthropic fallback pricing to the official table and export versioned price tables from both first-party adapters.

  The `ANTHROPIC_MODELS` seed rows had never been audited against the published price list and overcharged every current Claude model: Fable 5 was seeded at exactly 2x the official rate (20/100 vs 10/50 per MTok, cache rates likewise), Opus 4.8 at 12/60 vs 5/25, Opus 4.7 at 10/50 vs 5/25, and Opus 4.6 at 15/75 vs 5/25. Claude Sonnet 5 now carries its introductory price (2/10, in effect through 2026-08-31); Haiku 4.5 and Sonnet 4.6 were already correct. Cost reports for affected models drop accordingly, and budget ceilings admit roughly twice the work they previously rejected.

  New exports `ANTHROPIC_PRICING` (`anthropic-2026-07-16`) and `OPENAI_PRICING` (`openai-2026-07-16`) publish the seed rows as versioned `PriceTable`s for `createEngine({ pricing })`, so runs journal a concrete pricing version instead of `unpriced` and price revisions become explicit table updates. `createTestEngine` gained a `pricing` passthrough for testing against a versioned table.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- df416fc: Correct and extend model pricing: GPT-5.6 entries, long-context tiers, no fabricated prices, no double-charged cache.

  - `Pricing` gains optional long-context `tiers` (`PricingTier`): the highest threshold strictly below the full prompt re-prices the entire request, input-side rates (cache included) scaling by `inputMultiplier` and the output rate by `outputMultiplier`. Existing linear rows are untouched.
  - `@rulvar/openai` seeds `gpt-5.6-sol` and its `gpt-5.6` alias with the official caps and pricing (1,050,000 context, 128,000 max output, $5/$0.50/$30 per MTok, $6.25 cache write, 2x input and 1.5x output above 272K input tokens). Previously the unknown-model fallback silently priced them as gpt-5.4.
  - Unknown model ids in both first-class adapters keep conservative transport caps but no longer receive a fabricated price row: their usage surfaces in `CostReport.unpriced` and a USD ceiling warns that it cannot bound them. Provide a versioned `createEngine({ pricing })` row for hosted models the tables do not know yet.
  - `priceUsdOf` no longer double-charges cache tokens: under the Usage invariant `inputTokens` is the full prompt, so the input rate now bills only the uncached remainder while cache reads and writes bill at their own rates (a row without cache rates bills them at the input rate). Cache-heavy runs previously over-attributed cost by the full input rate on every cached token.
  - Admission reserve estimation routes through the same `priceUsdOf`, so estimates and settled costs share one formula, tiers included.
  - Model id resolution picks the longest matching table prefix, so a dated `gpt-5.5-pro-...` snapshot resolves to the pro entry, never the shorter `gpt-5.5` sibling.

- 886d065: Make the first-class adapters genuinely streaming: every canonical event is yielded AS its provider event is consumed.

  Both adapters (and `openaiCompatible`) buffered the complete canonical event stream in an internal array and yielded it only after the provider response finished. Consequences fixed by this change: `agent:stream` was never live; the stream-idle watchdog saw zero events during healthy generation, so any turn longer than `streamIdleTimeoutMs` (default 120s) was falsely severed as idle and retried; a budget or external abort lost ALL partial usage (the journal recorded zero for tokens the provider billed); and every delta of a long response was retained in memory.

  - `mapAnthropicStream`, `mapResponsesStream`, and `mapChatCompletionsStream` are now async generators: they yield each `ChatEvent` as the corresponding provider event is consumed, with the consumer's pull as the only pacing (natural backpressure, no queue, no detached work). The Anthropic mapper's return value carries the accumulated `pause_turn` state; `TurnMapping` no longer has the redundant `events` array field. Callers of the old callback signatures (`emit` parameter) must switch to iterating the generator.
  - Adapter behavior is preserved: canonical id mapping, thinking/reasoning retention, `pause_turn` continuation and its cap (each segment now streams live before the continuation dispatches), tool argument assembly, typed refusals and errors, exactly one canonical terminal event, the degraded Chat Completions path (visible in `providerMetadata.openai.degradedPath`), abort propagation, usage normalization, and SDK autoretries disabled.
  - New regression tests with gated fake SDK clients prove the first `stream().next()` resolves before the provider terminal exists, aborts reach the in-flight provider iterable after the first delta, a paused consumer causes zero read-ahead (lock-step pulls), `pause_turn` segment deltas arrive before the continuation request, and exactly one terminal event survives.

### Patch Changes

- da4dbad: Write the product name as Rulvar in prose: package READMEs, npm descriptions, and the
  documentation site now capitalize the brand. Identifiers keep their exact casing, so
  package names, the `rulvar` binary, `rulvar.config.mjs`, the `.rulvar` store directory,
  the `rulvar.*` OTel attributes, and every URL are unchanged. Documentation and metadata
  only; no runtime behaviour changes.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- ddef383: Every published package now ships a README, so its npm page states what the package is, how it installs, and where the documentation lives (npm includes README.md in the tarball regardless of the files allowlist, so no manifest changes are involved; @rulvar/compat gains its README on its own next release). Alongside, the repository-level pages are refreshed to the current project state: the root README is rewritten around the never-pay-twice pitch with a runnable quickstart condensation and the full package table, CONTRIBUTING.md lists the complete PR gate set, the examples README drops retired-spec citations for live docs.rulvar.com links and documents the dogfood journal replay, and the pointer README gets the same treatment.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 7d1552e: Runtime message strings no longer cite the retired internal specification set: error and warning messages, validation issues, and the CLI help text drop the dangling `docs/NN, section ...` references, pointing at https://docs.rulvar.com pages where a pointer earns its place (the CLI help header, tool naming, toolset registries, bare resume). The umbrella package description sheds the naming-contingency note: the unscoped alias is published and owned. Three strings embedded in frozen recordings stay byte-identical on purpose (the no-progress abort reason and two testing-internal recorder strings), as does the byte-locked golden-fold fixture. Test-file comments lose their citations too; test titles are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 154507b: TSDoc and inline comments no longer cite the retired internal specification set (the pre-docs-site `docs/NN, section ...` references).

Comment-only change: no runtime behavior, no API shapes, and no runtime message strings were modified; the frozen golden-fold fixture is byte-identical.

## 1.1.0

### Patch Changes

- f2253cb: The adapter scrubs constrained-decoding-unsupported keywords from the wire copy of strict tool schemas and output format schemas (`minimum`, `maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`, `multipleOf`, `maxItems`; measured live, docs/04 section 4.3 as amended). The orchestrator's spawn tools carry integer minimums, so every live orchestrate run died with a pre-first-call 400 ("For 'integer' type, property 'minimum' is not supported") at zero cost, which is what kept criterion 2 of the M12 checkpoint unmeasurable. The engine-side schema stays unscrubbed and still validates tool args and structured output, so the dropped keywords remain enforced; only the model-side hint is lost.
- 63b2c01: Two defects the first live M12 checkpoint run surfaced. The Anthropic capability table lacked a Haiku 4.5 entry, so the dated id fell through to the current-generation default and the adapter sent adaptive thinking, which that model rejects with a live 400 (every haiku run died at zero cost): `claude-haiku-4-5` (and its dated snapshots by the prefix rule) now resolves to the enabled-budget thinking form with real haiku pricing, meaning the default wire omits thinking entirely. And the checkpoint's criterion 2 could pass vacuously when both arms scored zero at zero cost (zero satisfies "at least equal at no more cost"): the card-informed arm must now win something real (nonzero n and pass rate) before the criterion can hold.
- 99dc3ed: The second Haiku 4.5 wire incompatibility (the first live probe after the caps entry): the model also rejects the top-level effort parameter with a 400, so its capability entry now declares empty reasoningEfforts and the router scrubs effort off the wire (the requested effort stays in identity). Verified live: a haiku run completes ok.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ac274f4: M4-T01 role protocol completion. The full trigger protocol for the six
  invocation roles lands in `@rulvar/core` (`model/roles.ts`):

  - Extract necessity is completed per docs/04 section 8.3: a separate
    final structured-output invocation fires when a schema is set AND
    (routing directs extract to a different model OR the loop model's
    required tier cannot ride a tools-available turn OR finalize is
    routed). The required-tier rule is new: a `forced-tool` tier pins
    toolChoice to `emit_result` and cannot ride while the agent's tools
    must remain available, so such agents now pay one separate extract
    call instead of silently losing tool access. Agents without tools
    keep the M1 single-shot behavior byte for byte.
  - The finalize role fires for the first time: only when configured in
    routing and only for tool-bearing agents, as one synthesis invocation
    with toolChoice `'none'` over the full transcript after tools stop.
    Its text is the output for schema-less calls; with a schema the
    separate extract runs over the transcript including the synthesis.
  - A separate extract invocation over a tool-bearing transcript now
    carries the agent's tool contracts (both providers reject tool-use
    history without tool definitions) with toolChoice pinned to `'none'`
    or to `emit_result` per tier.
  - Both adapters map `toolChoice: 'none'` to the provider's explicit
    none choice with the tools param present instead of dropping tools
    from the request.
  - `createTestEngine` no longer routes `finalize` by default: the
    routing key is the firing opt-in, and the old default would have
    summoned a synthesis call for every tool-bearing test agent. Tests
    that want finalize route it explicitly.

  Identity is untouched: extract and finalize resolutions never enter
  the spawn content key, and existing journals replay unchanged.

- 5735d92: M4-T02 HistoryProjector. Cross-provider history projection lands in
  `@rulvar/core` (`model/projector.ts`) and the retention pipeline that
  feeds it:

  - `projectHistory` projects the canonical history into a target
    provider's view: provider-raw parts ride if and only if the target
    adapter's provider family matches the part's provider; everything
    else passes through untouched. The agent loop projects EVERY outgoing
    request (loop turns, finalize, extract), so per-role provider mixing
    inside one agent yields a valid wire history on each side.
  - Retention transport: adapters ship a turn's blocks-to-retain in
    stream order via `finish.providerMetadata[<adapter id>].retainedParts`;
    the runtime lifts them into provider-raw parts at the HEAD of the
    turn's canonical assistant message. `@rulvar/anthropic` ships thinking
    and redacted_thinking blocks (signatures intact, pause_turn
    continuations included); `@rulvar/openai` ships reasoning items with
    their encrypted_content. Retained blocks now actually reach the
    canonical history, survive checkpoints, and echo byte-exact to their
    own provider on every subsequent turn.
  - `ProviderAdapter` gains an optional `provider` field: the provider
    family for provider-raw matching (default = adapter id). The
    first-class adapters declare 'anthropic' and 'openai';
    `openaiCompatible` gateways declare 'openai' whatever their custom id,
    so same-family adapters share retained blocks and projections.

  Identity is untouched: projection state never enters content keys, and
  adapters that ship no retention payload (FakeAdapter included) produce
  byte-identical histories.

### Minor Changes

- 527c9b4: M1-T12/T13: the two first-class adapters on the July 2026 surfaces.
  @rulvar/anthropic: adaptive thinking, the output_config umbrella (effort
  passthrough including max, native json_schema format), strict tools,
  cache_control compilation from cacheHint (deepest-4 kept), thinking-block
  retention with provider-granularity projection, pause_turn absorption
  without synthetic user messages, the full stop-reason table with typed
  refusal stop details, count_tokens, capabilities-bearing refreshCaps,
  retry-after/x-ratelimit/529 signaling, SDK autoretries disabled, usage
  normalization under the Usage invariant. @rulvar/openai: Responses API
  with manual item replay only (store false, encrypted reasoning echoed
  verbatim; previous_response_id/Conversations rejected as ConfigError),
  flattened strict function tools, text.format json_schema, the typed SSE
  catalog mapped to ChatEvent, the Chat Completions degraded path (visible
  via providerMetadata), effort mapping with the documented lossy
  max-to-xhigh downmap and provider none via providerOptions only, usage
  normalization.
