PlanRunner spawn telemetry, the missing evals export, and the conformance kit's new meta field (v1.22.0 review P2-5, P2-6, P1-2).

- `@rulvar/plan`: PlanRunner journals every admission INSIDE a carrying entry (decomposition rows in escalation decisions, ladder-verdict respawns, reuse and graft links, revision admissions) and emitted no `spawn:admitted`/`spawn:rejected` at all; a live PlanRunner run with admitted roots showed an event count of zero. Every embedded admission row now announces through one formatter, identically on the live path and on replay absorb, with `replayed: true` on recovered rows, `entryRef` on the journaled carrying entry, and `agentType` resolved from the landed specs.
- `@rulvar/evals`: `agentTypeRuleHolds` joins the package root next to `rungRuleHolds`, exactly as the v1.21.0 changelog had already announced; a public-API test now imports the checkpoint quartet from the root. The evals guide gains a full measured-value checkpoint section (ladder/pool/cell/arm vocabulary, both criteria, the vacuous-pass guard, cost discipline, a runnable example).
- `@rulvar/store-conformance`: the meta round-trip case now also pins the new optional `RunMeta.segments` field, which the engine bumps durably at every resume to keep event `seq`/`spanId` unique per run.
