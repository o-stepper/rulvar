'@rulvar/core': minor
---

The project is renamed to rulvar (the founder decision of 2026-07-11 closing OQ-24; the official domain is rulvar.com). Every package moves to the @rulvar scope (the umbrella is @rulvar/rulvar, the ESLint plugin is eslint-plugin-rulvar), the CLI binary is `rulvar`, the config convention is rulvar.config.mjs, the knowledge store default is rulvar.models.json, the default journal directory is .rulvar, engine warnings use the RULVAR_ prefix, and the orchestrator workflow name is rulvar-orchestrate. Because journaled bytes embed the workflow name and content keys, the entire frozen catalog (60 cassettes and the dogfood journals) was re-recorded under the new name and re-frozen; the turbo lint task now orders after upstream builds (a latent race the rename surfaced). Nothing was ever published under the former name, so no consumer migration exists.
