Record the genesis args binding in RunMeta and make the dry-run preview mutation-free (the v1.23.0 review). `RunMeta` gains `argsProvided` (whether the run started with defined args) and `argsHash` (sha256 over the JCS canonical serialization of the genesis args, never the raw value), written by the engine at genesis and preserved verbatim by every resume segment, so hosts can refuse a resume whose re-supplied args silently diverge from the original invocation; the new public `hashRunArgs()` derives the same hash host-side. Legacy metas never gain the marker retroactively, and unserializable args record presence without a hash. A `dryRun` resume now performs ZERO store mutations by invariant: `putMeta` is skipped entirely (no status flip, no `segments` bump), the compiled-source blob is not re-put, and the Replayer's single append site refuses any journal append under replay-strict with a typed `JournalMissError`. The store conformance kit checks the round-trip of both new fields.
