M8-T02: createWorker, the queue shell (docs/02 section 8.3; FR-703), plus the two queue seams it stands on (docs/06 10.2 and docs/03 12.3, M8 entry amendment).

- `@lurker/cli`: `createWorker(engine, { store: LeasableStore, concurrency? })` leases resumable and suspended runs via acquire/renew/release with fencing epochs (renew cadence ttl/3; Appendix A reference ttl 60000 ms; concurrency default 1). A store without lease capability is a typed ConfigError at start, never a silent split-brain; leasing a store other than `engine.stores.journal` is equally a ConfigError. DEF-6 repeats at acquire: a journal outside the hashVersion window releases the lease and poisons the run for this worker. Stateless workers call bare `engine.resume` with the lease; unchanged suspended runs are skipped until their journal grows; queue semantics stay honestly at-least-once with deduplication by the journal. The OQ-21 residual (original in-process args are not journaled) is bridged by the optional `argsFor` hook.
- `@lurker/core`: `ResumeOptions.lease` carries the worker's lease through the kernel's single append site, so a stale writer's appends are rejected by the fencing epoch and never become visible (lease theft impossible by construction); bare `engine.resume(runId)` now falls back from the persisted CompiledWorkflow source to `defaults.workflows[workflowName]` (the registry the queue worker resolves through, docs/06 10.4); the Replayer accepts the lease option.
