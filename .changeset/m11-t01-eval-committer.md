M11-T01: the eval-committer identity activates eval-measured claims (docs/05, sections "Data model" and "Commit discipline", amended with the dedicated `eval-committer` GateRecord variant, distinct from the v2-reserved eval-confirmed proposal auto-gate).

- Commit validation is now GATE-DRIVEN and the coherence square is schema-enforced in both directions: an eval-committer-gated op MUST carry class eval-measured, author kind eval-pipeline, and the metrics block; a human-gated op MUST NOT carry any of the three (a human-authored op with metrics keeps rejecting). Observational data never carries metrics and never auto-promotes.
- `@rulvar/evals` ships the pipeline side: `evalMeasuredClaim` (the docs/05 TTL table applied by polarity: strength 90 days, weakness 30) and `commitEvalMeasured` with the documented CAS-rebase recipe against any ModelKnowledgeStore.
