M11-T04: modelEpoch capture and the canary fingerprint (docs/05, section "Grounding and decay"; OQ-06 CLOSED with the committed design).

- Core: `modelEpochOf`/`capsHashOf` build the honestly coarse epoch signal (registry version, pricing version, caps hash; silent alias re-pointing stays a documented uncaught case absent probes). The ClaimOp union gains `mark_stale` (docs/05 amended): section 6 requires status stale at fingerprint drift and the closed op set could not produce it; active flips to stale, already-stale is an idempotent noop, terminals never revive.
- Evals: `canaryFingerprint(engine, probes)` runs the FIXED caller-versioned probe set sequentially through the ordinary engine and hashes NFC-normalized, whitespace-collapsed outputs (the probe count prefixes the hash so probe-set edits never collide with drift). `flipStaleOnCanaryDrift` flips the model's active eval-measured claims whose recorded fingerprint differs, in one CAS-rebased command; claims without a baseline stay untouched. Sweeps stamp the epoch per pool member via `modelEpochFor`.
