M10 entry: the render budgets of docs/06 Appendix A are committed (the TBD-before-M10 rule) and wired as engine defaults; OQ-04 (the renderBudget measure) closes on the CHARACTER measure.

- WakeDigest: 400 chars per outputSummary row, one exported constant (`WAKE_SUMMARY_RENDER_BUDGET_CHARS`) now serving both the distillation cap (adopted unchanged, the value frozen into every cassette since M6) and the digest render default of `renderBudgetChars`, which stays overridable per orchestration.
- ledger_read render: 65536 chars over the serialized view via the new pure `boundLedgerRender` (exported with `LEDGER_RENDER_BUDGET_CHARS`): over budget, rows drop deterministically oldest-first (auto-derived joins before authored sections, the mission brief slices last) and every drop renders as a FLAGGED discrepancy line. The section caps stay the primary bound, so under default termination limits the belt never engages; all frozen fixtures are byte-identical.
- KB card: 4096 chars, committed in docs and consumed by the M10-T03 card renderer.
