M9-T04 (part 3): the six DEF-8 catalog cassettes plus the DEF-7 reserve-survives-run-exhaustion row (docs/09 sections 6.7 and 6.8), with the roll-forward and reserve producers the rows exposed.

- Seven new frozen cassettes with public runners and byte-for-byte replay tests: revise-racing-defaultDecision (the mandatory stale-wake trio dropping dep_already_resolved with blockingRef, node_escalated, node_already_done in ONE revision), crash-after-append-before-effects (the pre-effects kill point; both children spawn live exactly once on resume and the request-only cancel lands on the redispatched branch), amend-vs-running-then-cancel-add, intra-revision-self-conflict (sequential intra-revision semantics), bad-base-streak-terminates (three fabricated-base all-dropped entries then the non-HITL guards fallback), park-races-child-completion (parkRequested extinguished by the child-result transition, no park retention), and reserve-survives-run-exhaustion (adds that would invade the committed finalize reserve drop admission_denied inside the revision outcomes; the forced finish executes FROM the reserve and closes the run ok).
- `@lurker/plan`: the idempotent plan_revise recovery path now also re-lands request-only cancels and parks by aborting the redispatched mid-flight branch; previously the crash-after-append-before-effects roll-forward left the cancelled branch running forever.
- `@lurker/plan`: an accepted escalation resolution records the node's done reference (doneRefs), so a later waive_dep against the resolved dependency drops dep_already_resolved with the blockingRef pointing at the resolving reference, exactly like a child-result transition.
- `@lurker/core`: the forced finish now RELEASES the finalize reserve as it begins (releaseFinalizeReserve): the reserve stops subtracting from the admission remainder at the moment it is being spent, or the finalize agent could never draw the money reserved for it under a tight run ceiling. Admissions stay frozen past the cap, so nothing else can take it. Cap behavior under unlimited ceilings (all existing cassettes) is byte-identical.
- All 22 M9 cassettes re-record byte-identically under the double-run agreement; fixtures.sha256 covers 57 frozen files.
