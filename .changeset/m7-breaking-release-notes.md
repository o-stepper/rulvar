The v0.8.0 BREAKING release notes (M7 adaptive orchestration full; the flagged BREAKING minor of the pre-1.0 convention, docs/12 registry).

BREAKING: the unified `AdmitVerdict` union is extended with the reuse verdicts (`reuse_full`, `admit_graft`) and the new reject codes (`termination_exhausted`, `ladder_exceeds_frozen`, `lineage_exhausted`, `lineage_busy`, `osc_guard`) (DEF-5). How it fails: exhaustive switches over the verdict kind or reject code in custom shells and admission SPI extensions stop compiling. Migration: add branches for the new arms; reject-code switches should route unknown codes to their generic-denial path.

BREAKING: reuse-by-reference is the DEFAULT (DEF-5). A byte-identical `add_task` after a cancel or abandon no longer re-executes the subtree: the result returns by reference (`reuse_full`) or continues from the paid prefix (`admit_graft`). How it fails: changed semantics; runs that relied on re-execution against a changed world observe referenced results instead. This is the only intentional change of visible semantics in the pre-1.0 line. Migration: set `reuse.enabled: false` on the admission config, or `fresh: true` on the specific `add_task`.

BREAKING: the config key `maxEscalationsPerNode` is renamed to `maxEscalationsPerLogicalTask` (XF-10): escalations count per logical task across respawns via the lineage chain. How it fails: a typed `ConfigError` naming the new key rejects the old one. Migration: rename the key; the default stays 2.

BREAKING: the plan-size-scaled revision budget option is removed without deprecation (DEF-2). `maxRevisionsPerRun` is an absolute, non-replenishable counter (default 32) debited by exactly 1 per journaled `plan_revise`; nothing increments it. How it fails: the removed option is rejected at config validation. Migration: size `maxRevisionsPerRun` directly.

BREAKING: `plan_revise` result and error schemas widen (rebase outcomes, embedded admissions, `revisionUnitsRemaining`) and `WakeDigest` gains the MANDATORY `termination` field beside `planHash`, `budget`, and `reuse` (DEF-2/DEF-8). How it fails: schemaHash and toolsetHash of orchestrator scopes change, so VCR cassettes recorded over orchestrator turns invalidate. Migration: re-record affected cassettes; consumers of the digest type add the new mandatory blocks (all-zero outside PlanRunner).

BREAKING: B0, the run budget ceiling, is immutable after start (DEF-2): no API, including HITL decisions, can top it up. How it fails: code that mutated the run budget mid-run or expected an HITL top-up hits a typed runtime error; overshoot stays bounded by one turn per in-flight agent. Migration: size the ceiling at start; use the orchestrator cap and the finalize reserve (DEF-7) for graceful degradation instead of top-ups.

BREAKING: PlanRunner requires a resolvable orchestrator cap (DEF-7). `orchestratePlanned` with no run USD ceiling and no explicit `budget.capUsd`, or with `effectiveCap < finalizeReserve`, refuses to start with a typed `OrchestratorCapConfigError` before any LLM call. Migration: pass `budget: { capUsd }` (or run under a USD ceiling and rely on `capFraction`, default 0.2; up to 1.0 opts out explicitly with a telemetry warning).
