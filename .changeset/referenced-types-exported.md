Types referenced by public signatures are now exported from their package barrels, so the API docs resolve them instead of carrying known incomplete references (v1.26.0 deep E2E review): `BaseAppend` from `@rulvar/core` (the fields common to every `Replayer` append), `Block` and `MappedStop` from `@rulvar/anthropic` (the wire level content block alias and the stop reason mapping), and `VcrHeader` from `@rulvar/testing` (the first line of every cassette file). The frozen TypeDoc baseline shrinks from eleven entries to the four vendored Standard Schema notices.
