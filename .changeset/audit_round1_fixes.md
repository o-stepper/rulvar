Production readiness fixes from the July 2026 full audit.

- `'readonly'` isolation now compiles a deny rule for tools declaring risk `write` or `destructive` into the spawn's permission chain, exactly as the tools guide documents; read tools and other isolation modes are unaffected.
- VCR `replay()` refuses a cassette recorded outside the engine's hashVersion support window (`[CURRENT-1, CURRENT]`) with a typed `ConfigError` instead of silently drifting; in-window cassettes replay as before.
- `InMemoryStore` accepts `{ quiet: true }` to opt out of the durability warning, and the warning text now states the precise truth: nothing survives a process exit and cross-process resume is impossible (same-process resume of a kept instance works). `createTestEngine` constructs its store quietly, so the blessed offline tier no longer prints a misleading warning.
- The bare `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` development warnings no longer blame workflow code for calls that originate in library internals (the engine's own retry jitter, provider SDKs): the retry jitter uses a natively captured `Math.random`, and the in-process guard skips callers that live under `node_modules`.
- `rulvar run --profile` now applies the profile's per-role effort hints: entries in `defaults.routing` that carry no effort are seeded from `RunProfile.effortByRole` (an explicit host effort always wins; ladder entries and unrouted roles stay untouched).
- `rulvar --help` documents the shipped `kb inbox` and `kb gate` subcommands.
- The unscoped `rulvar` pointer package ships TypeScript declarations (`index.d.ts` with a `types` export condition), so strict TypeScript projects can import the bare name; the install smoke gate now packs and checks the pointer alongside the umbrella.
