Production readiness fixes from the July 2026 full audit.

- The `budgetUsd` ceiling now survives resume: the engine records it in `RunMeta.budgetUsd` and restores it on every resume, so the replayed spend counts against the original invocation's bound and `ResumeOptions` still exposes no way to raise it. Journals written before the field existed (or read through a store that drops optional `RunMeta` fields) resume uncapped, exactly as before; the conformance kit gains a round-trip check so custom stores cannot drop the field silently.
- `spawn:rejected` and `resolution:applied` / `resolution:superseded` are now emitted: live admission rejections carry the rejection `code`, `agentType`, and the journaled decision `entryRef` (absent only for pre-admission config gates), and live resolution attempts report winning or losing the first-closing-wins fold. `spawn:admitted` now carries the decision `entryRef` and the admitting `verdict` arm. The `orchestrator:budget` union member now types the two payload shapes actually emitted; `journal:compat` stays declared but unemitted (the scan runs before a run's event stream exists) and its TSDoc says so.
- `toOtel` implements real parent-child span nesting when `contextApi` and `setSpan` are passed; without them spans stay flat but attributed.

- `'readonly'` isolation now compiles a deny rule for tools declaring risk `write` or `destructive` into the spawn's permission chain, exactly as the tools guide documents; read tools and other isolation modes are unaffected.
- VCR `replay()` refuses a cassette recorded outside the engine's hashVersion support window (`[CURRENT-1, CURRENT]`) with a typed `ConfigError` instead of silently drifting; in-window cassettes replay as before.
- `InMemoryStore` accepts `{ quiet: true }` to opt out of the durability warning, and the warning text now states the precise truth: nothing survives a process exit and cross-process resume is impossible (same-process resume of a kept instance works). `createTestEngine` constructs its store quietly, so the blessed offline tier no longer prints a misleading warning.
- The bare `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` development warnings no longer blame workflow code for calls that originate in library internals (the engine's own retry jitter, provider SDKs): the retry jitter uses a natively captured `Math.random`, and the in-process guard skips callers that live under `node_modules`.
- `rulvar run --profile` now applies the profile's per-role effort hints: entries in `defaults.routing` that carry no effort are seeded from `RunProfile.effortByRole` (an explicit host effort always wins; ladder entries and unrouted roles stay untouched).
- `rulvar --help` documents the shipped `kb inbox` and `kb gate` subcommands.
- The unscoped `rulvar` pointer package ships TypeScript declarations (`index.d.ts` with a `types` export condition), so strict TypeScript projects can import the bare name; the install smoke gate now packs and checks the pointer alongside the umbrella.
