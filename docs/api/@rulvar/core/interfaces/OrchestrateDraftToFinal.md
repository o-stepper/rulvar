# Interface: OrchestrateDraftToFinal

Defined in: [packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts:1529](https://github.com/o-stepper/rulvar/blob/main/packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts#L1529)

How the shipped artifact relates to the draft the run composed it
from (RV2509), present on the acceptance envelope whenever a
synthesis was configured. Two hashes and the answer they imply: a
semantic verdict rendered over the draft describes the final only
when `rewritten` is false, and until this shipped a consumer had no
way to ask.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Defined in |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| <a id="property-claimsjudgedon"></a> `claimsJudgedOn?` | `"draft"` \| `"final"` \| `"both"` | Which documents the claim-consistency pass actually judged; absent when it never ran. | [packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts:1537](https://github.com/o-stepper/rulvar/blob/main/packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts#L1537) |
| <a id="property-drafthash"></a> `draftHash` | `string` | sha256 over the canonical coordination draft. | [packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts:1531](https://github.com/o-stepper/rulvar/blob/main/packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts#L1531) |
| <a id="property-finalhash"></a> `finalHash` | `string` | sha256 over the canonical artifact the run settled on. | [packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts:1533](https://github.com/o-stepper/rulvar/blob/main/packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts#L1533) |
| <a id="property-rewritten"></a> `rewritten` | `boolean` | False exactly when the two hashes agree: the synthesis returned the draft unchanged. | [packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts:1535](https://github.com/o-stepper/rulvar/blob/main/packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrate.ts#L1535) |
