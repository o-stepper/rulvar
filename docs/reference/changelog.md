# Changelog

All packages in the fixed group release in lockstep with identical
versions; `@rulvar/compat` is versioned independently. The sections
below mirror each package's `CHANGELOG.md` as written by Changesets.

## @rulvar/anthropic

### 1.4.0

#### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c4f563d]
  - @rulvar/core@1.4.0

### 1.3.2

#### Patch Changes

- ddef383: Every published package now ships a README, so its npm page states what the package is, how it installs, and where the documentation lives (npm includes README.md in the tarball regardless of the files allowlist, so no manifest changes are involved; @rulvar/compat gains its README on its own next release). Alongside, the repository-level pages are refreshed to the current project state: the root README is rewritten around the never-pay-twice pitch with a runnable quickstart condensation and the full package table, CONTRIBUTING.md lists the complete PR gate set, the examples README drops retired-spec citations for live docs.rulvar.com links and documents the dogfood journal replay, and the pointer README gets the same treatment.
- Updated dependencies [ddef383]
  - @rulvar/core@1.3.2

### 1.3.1

#### Patch Changes

- 7d1552e: Runtime message strings no longer cite the retired internal specification set: error and warning messages, validation issues, and the CLI help text drop the dangling `docs/NN, section ...` references, pointing at https://docs.rulvar.com pages where a pointer earns its place (the CLI help header, tool naming, toolset registries, bare resume). The umbrella package description sheds the naming-contingency note: the unscoped alias is published and owned. Three strings embedded in frozen recordings stay byte-identical on purpose (the no-progress abort reason and two testing-internal recorder strings), as does the byte-locked golden-fold fixture. Test-file comments lose their citations too; test titles are unchanged.
- Updated dependencies [7d1552e]
  - @rulvar/core@1.3.1

### 1.3.0

#### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7d1a287]
  - @rulvar/core@1.3.0

### 1.2.0

#### Patch Changes

- 154507b: TSDoc and inline comments no longer cite the retired internal specification set (the pre-docs-site `docs/NN, section ...` references). The citations either became links to the public documentation at docs.rulvar.com or were dropped where the comment already carried the rule; traceability markers (DEF-n, XF-nn, FR-nnn, OQ-nn, W-nnn) are untouched. Comment-only change: no runtime behavior, no API shapes, and no runtime message strings were modified; the frozen golden-fold fixture is byte-identical.

### 1.1.0

#### Patch Changes

- f2253cb: The adapter scrubs constrained-decoding-unsupported keywords from the wire copy of strict tool schemas and output format schemas (`minimum`, `maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`, `multipleOf`, `maxItems`; measured live, docs/04 section 4.3 as amended). The orchestrator's spawn tools carry integer minimums, so every live orchestrate run died with a pre-first-call 400 ("For 'integer' type, property 'minimum' is not supported") at zero cost, which is what kept criterion 2 of the M12 checkpoint unmeasurable. The engine-side schema stays unscrubbed and still validates tool args and structured output, so the dropped keywords remain enforced; only the model-side hint is lost.
- 63b2c01: Two defects the first live M12 checkpoint run surfaced. The Anthropic capability table lacked a Haiku 4.5 entry, so the dated id fell through to the current-generation default and the adapter sent adaptive thinking, which that model rejects with a live 400 (every haiku run died at zero cost): `claude-haiku-4-5` (and its dated snapshots by the prefix rule) now resolves to the enabled-budget thinking form with real haiku pricing, meaning the default wire omits thinking entirely. And the checkpoint's criterion 2 could pass vacuously when both arms scored zero at zero cost (zero satisfies "at least equal at no more cost"): the card-informed arm must now win something real (nonzero n and pass rate) before the criterion can hold.
- 99dc3ed: The second Haiku 4.5 wire incompatibility (the first live probe after the caps entry): the model also rejects the top-level effort parameter with a 400, so its capability entry now declares empty reasoningEfforts and the router scrubs effort off the wire (the requested effort stays in identity). Verified live: a haiku run completes ok.

### 0.5.0

#### Minor Changes

- ac274f4: M4-T01 role protocol completion. The full trigger protocol for the six
  invocation roles lands in `@rulvar/core` (`model/roles.ts`):

  - Extract necessity is completed per docs/04 section 8.3: a separate
    final structured-output invocation fires when a schema is set AND
    (routing directs extract to a different model OR the loop model's
    required tier cannot ride a tools-available turn OR finalize is
    routed). The required-tier rule is new: a `forced-tool` tier pins
    toolChoice to `emit_result` and cannot ride while the agent's tools
    must remain available, so such agents now pay one separate extract
    call instead of silently losing tool access. Agents without tools
    keep the M1 single-shot behavior byte for byte.
  - The finalize role fires for the first time: only when configured in
    routing and only for tool-bearing agents, as one synthesis invocation
    with toolChoice `'none'` over the full transcript after tools stop.
    Its text is the output for schema-less calls; with a schema the
    separate extract runs over the transcript including the synthesis.
  - A separate extract invocation over a tool-bearing transcript now
    carries the agent's tool contracts (both providers reject tool-use
    history without tool definitions) with toolChoice pinned to `'none'`
    or to `emit_result` per tier.
  - Both adapters map `toolChoice: 'none'` to the provider's explicit
    none choice with the tools param present instead of dropping tools
    from the request.
  - `createTestEngine` no longer routes `finalize` by default: the
    routing key is the firing opt-in, and the old default would have
    summoned a synthesis call for every tool-bearing test agent. Tests
    that want finalize route it explicitly.

  Identity is untouched: extract and finalize resolutions never enter
  the spawn content key, and existing journals replay unchanged.

- 5735d92: M4-T02 HistoryProjector. Cross-provider history projection lands in
  `@rulvar/core` (`model/projector.ts`) and the retention pipeline that
  feeds it:

  - `projectHistory` projects the canonical history into a target
    provider's view: provider-raw parts ride if and only if the target
    adapter's provider family matches the part's provider; everything
    else passes through untouched. The agent loop projects EVERY outgoing
    request (loop turns, finalize, extract), so per-role provider mixing
    inside one agent yields a valid wire history on each side.
  - Retention transport: adapters ship a turn's blocks-to-retain in
    stream order via `finish.providerMetadata[<adapter id>].retainedParts`;
    the runtime lifts them into provider-raw parts at the HEAD of the
    turn's canonical assistant message. `@rulvar/anthropic` ships thinking
    and redacted_thinking blocks (signatures intact, pause_turn
    continuations included); `@rulvar/openai` ships reasoning items with
    their encrypted_content. Retained blocks now actually reach the
    canonical history, survive checkpoints, and echo byte-exact to their
    own provider on every subsequent turn.
  - `ProviderAdapter` gains an optional `provider` field: the provider
    family for provider-raw matching (default = adapter id). The
    first-class adapters declare 'anthropic' and 'openai';
    `openaiCompatible` gateways declare 'openai' whatever their custom id,
    so same-family adapters share retained blocks and projections.

  Identity is untouched: projection state never enters content keys, and
  adapters that ship no retention payload (FakeAdapter included) produce
  byte-identical histories.

### 0.2.0

#### Minor Changes

- 527c9b4: M1-T12/T13: the two first-class adapters on the July 2026 surfaces.
  @rulvar/anthropic: adaptive thinking, the output_config umbrella (effort
  passthrough including max, native json_schema format), strict tools,
  cache_control compilation from cacheHint (deepest-4 kept), thinking-block
  retention with provider-granularity projection, pause_turn absorption
  without synthetic user messages, the full stop-reason table with typed
  refusal stop details, count_tokens, capabilities-bearing refreshCaps,
  retry-after/x-ratelimit/529 signaling, SDK autoretries disabled, usage
  normalization under the Usage invariant. @rulvar/openai: Responses API
  with manual item replay only (store false, encrypted reasoning echoed
  verbatim; previous_response_id/Conversations rejected as ConfigError),
  flattened strict function tools, text.format json_schema, the typed SSE
  catalog mapped to ChatEvent, the Chat Completions degraded path (visible
  via providerMetadata), effort mapping with the documented lossy
  max-to-xhigh downmap and provider none via providerOptions only, usage
  normalization.

### 0.1.0

#### Minor Changes

- f4e2be9: M0 repo bootstrap (v0.1.0, docs/10-implementation-plan.md section "M0"):
  monorepo scaffold on the committed toolchain (pnpm 11 workspaces with
  catalogs, TypeScript 6.0, tsdown, Vitest 4, ESLint 9 flat config,
  Turborepo 2, changesets fixed mode, npm trusted publishing), the docs/
  canon as single source of truth, the L0 contracts skeleton in @rulvar/core,
  and the vendored dependencies (StandardSchemaV1/StandardJSONSchemaV1 types,
  the @cfworker/json-schema lineage validator subset, a first-party monotonic
  ULID). Placeholder scaffolds only: no public API ships in this release.

### 1.0.0

#### Minor Changes

- b728c48: M9-T01: bridgeAiSdk, the long-tail provider bridge (docs/04 section 7; FR-1xx). First real public surface of @rulvar/bridge-ai-sdk.

  - `bridgeAiSdk(model, options?)` wraps any Vercel AI SDK LanguageModelV4 (`@ai-sdk/provider` ^4, catalog-pinned per docs/13 "Dependency baseline pins") as a rulvar ProviderAdapter for the long tail (Google, Bedrock, Vertex). A wrong `specificationVersion` fails at construction with a typed ConfigError, so a transitive provider-package major cannot mis-wire silently.
  - The full ChatEvent vocabulary streams through: text and reasoning deltas, tool-call start/delta/end with engine-minted canonical ids mapped bijectively onto the wrapped provider's wire ids, incremental-free usage normalized under the Usage invariant (inputTokens always covers cache reads and writes), typed finish outcomes (length to max-tokens, content-filter to a typed refusal carrying the raw stop reason), and exactly one terminal event per stream.
  - Retention rides `finish.providerMetadata[<id>].retainedParts` (docs/04 section 2.3): assembled reasoning parts with their provider signatures, custom blocks, generated files, and provider-executed tool exchanges round-trip to same-family models; response-side providerMetadata reinserts as prompt-side providerOptions.
  - Conservative caps for a surface that has no introspection (the openaiCompatible posture, except structuredOutput 'native' because V4 responseFormat json is the interface-native mechanism); `options.caps` overrides per model. Canonical effort maps one to one for low/medium/high/xhigh; `max` downmaps to `xhigh` and the downmap is recorded in providerMetadata. cacheHint is ignored silently per docs/04 section 1.7.
  - Errors: `aiSdkErrorToWire` projects thrown APICallErrors as typed WireErrors (429 as retryable rate-limit with retryAfterMs from the retry-after header; 5xx and status-less network failures retryable transport; other statuses terminal). Documented as the highest-churn package in the set; its provider-major bumps ride BREAKING releases, never minors.

### 1.4.0

#### Minor Changes

- c4f563d: Production readiness fixes from the July 2026 full audit.

  - The `budgetUsd` ceiling now survives resume: the engine records it in `RunMeta.budgetUsd` and restores it on every resume, so the replayed spend counts against the original invocation's bound and `ResumeOptions` still exposes no way to raise it. Journals written before the field existed (or read through a store that drops optional `RunMeta` fields) resume uncapped, exactly as before; the conformance kit gains a round-trip check so custom stores cannot drop the field silently.
  - `spawn:rejected` and `resolution:applied` / `resolution:superseded` are now emitted: live admission rejections carry the rejection `code`, `agentType`, and the journaled decision `entryRef` (absent only for pre-admission config gates), and live resolution attempts report winning or losing the first-closing-wins fold. `spawn:admitted` now carries the decision `entryRef` and the admitting `verdict` arm. The `orchestrator:budget` union member now types the two payload shapes actually emitted; `journal:compat` stays declared but unemitted (the scan runs before a run's event stream exists) and its TSDoc says so.
  - `toOtel` implements real parent-child span nesting when `contextApi` and `setSpan` are passed; without them spans stay flat but attributed.

  - `'readonly'` isolation now compiles a deny rule for tools declaring risk `write` or `destructive` into the spawn's permission chain, exactly as the tools guide documents; read tools and other isolation modes are unaffected.
  - VCR `replay()` refuses a cassette recorded outside the engine's hashVersion support window (`[CURRENT-1, CURRENT]`) with a typed `ConfigError` instead of silently drifting; in-window cassettes replay as before.
  - `InMemoryStore` accepts `{ quiet: true }` to opt out of the durability warning, and the warning text now states the precise truth: nothing survives a process exit and cross-process resume is impossible (same-process resume of a kept instance works). `createTestEngine` constructs its store quietly, so the blessed offline tier no longer prints a misleading warning.
  - The bare `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` development warnings no longer blame workflow code for calls that originate in library internals (the engine's own retry jitter, provider SDKs): the retry jitter uses a natively captured `Math.random`, and the in-process guard skips callers that live under `node_modules`.
  - `rulvar run --profile` now applies the profile's per-role effort hints: entries in `defaults.routing` that carry no effort are seeded from `RunProfile.effortByRole` (an explicit host effort always wins; ladder entries and unrouted roles stay untouched).
  - `rulvar --help` documents the shipped `kb inbox` and `kb gate` subcommands.
  - The unscoped `rulvar` pointer package ships TypeScript declarations (`index.d.ts` with a `types` export condition), so strict TypeScript projects can import the bare name; the install smoke gate now packs and checks the pointer alongside the umbrella.

Alongside, the repository-level pages are refreshed to the current project state: the root README is rewritten around the never-pay-twice pitch with a runnable quickstart condensation and the full package table, CONTRIBUTING.md lists the complete PR gate set, the examples README drops retired-spec citations for live docs.rulvar.com links and documents the dogfood journal replay, and the pointer README gets the same treatment.

The umbrella package description sheds the naming-contingency note: the unscoped alias is published and owned. Three strings embedded in frozen recordings stay byte-identical on purpose (the no-progress abort reason and two testing-internal recorder strings), as does the byte-locked golden-fold fixture. Test-file comments lose their citations too; test titles are unchanged.

### 1.3.0

#### Minor Changes

- 969974f: rulvar kb inbox (M12-T03): aggregates kb_propose-born proposals from finished runs through the RunLedger fold behind the LedgerExport seam. Matching (subject, taskClass, polarity) triples group for display ONLY (the command writes nothing, authorizes no spend and schedules no sweeps); each proposal renders with full provenance (initiating run identity, proposal entryRef, lineage, tier, trigger, evidence refs) plus the typed template statement a gated claim would carry; proposals of runs finished more than fourteen days ago expire out of the view. This is the human review surface, so the quarantined note and concrete model names render here verbatim, exactly like kb list.
- 64aff88: rulvar kb gate (M12-T04, the closing task of ModelKnowledge phase 3): the human gate flow turning one inbox proposal into a human-editorial claim. The attribution attestation is mandatory by construction (without --ruled-out over the closed checklist the GateRecord does not assemble and nothing is written; contrast evidence rides --contrast-run or --contrast-eval); the born claim carries the typed template statement (never the quarantined note), origin provenance back to the proposing run and entry, evidence resolving into that run's journal, and the editorial TTL. The commit is CAS against the per-project rulvar.models.json, whose git review is the authenticating gate. Non-proposal entries, expired proposals (fourteen days from the run's terminal updatedAt), running runs and already-gated proposals reject with typed errors.

### 1.2.0

#### Patch Changes

- 154507b: TSDoc and inline comments no longer cite the retired internal specification set (the pre-docs-site `docs/NN, section ...` references). The citations either became links to the public documentation at docs.rulvar.com or were dropped where the comment already carried the rule; traceability markers (DEF-n, XF-nn, FR-nnn, OQ-nn, W-nnn) are untouched. Comment-only change: no runtime behavior, no API shapes, and no runtime message strings were modified; the frozen golden-fold fixture is byte-identical.

### 1.0.0

#### Minor Changes

- 93eae2c: M10-T04: `rulvar kb list` (docs/05, section "Read path"; docs/06, section 10.5). The second consumption path: claims of the per-project store (./rulvar.models.json) render with full provenance for the humans who author ladders, floors, and profiles: author and gate identity, evidence refs (journal seqs and eval reports), metrics when present, supersede chains, proposal origin, and the TTL state (holds or EXPIRED) per the docs/05 decay table. No run and no pin are involved, so the maintenance view names models verbatim; only in-run cards are nameless. The grammar members `kb inbox` (phase 3, M12) and `kb sweep` (phase 2, M11) fail loudly naming their phases until they ship.
- fef6263: M11-T05: `rulvar kb sweep` (docs/05, section "Grounding and decay"). Falsification sweeps run manually, from CI, or from a user cron, never engine-scheduled, configured by the `kbSweep` section of rulvar.config.mjs (committerId, the FIXED model pool, taskClass-tagged eval cases, optional thresholds and canary probes; @rulvar/evals loads dynamically like @rulvar/planner does for plan).

  - The falsification guarantee: the matrix is the configured pool UNIONED with every model carrying an active, unexpired negative claim, plus the re-measurement queue (expired active eval claims); the pool renders with each member's origin.
  - With canary probes configured, every pool member fingerprints BEFORE measurement and drift flips its eval claims to stale in place; the sweep then re-measures and commits threshold-crossing claims through the eval-committer identity, reporting cells, emitted claims, and the committed store version.

### 0.9.0

#### Minor Changes

- 65c7b2c: M8-T01: createServer, the HTTP shell (docs/02 section 8.2; FR-702), plus the Engine.stores seam it stands on (docs/06 10.2, M8 entry amendment).

  - `@rulvar/cli`: `createServer({ engine, workflows })` returns `{ fetch(req: Request): Promise<Response> }` with the five canonical routes: POST /runs (start a registered workflow), GET /runs/:id (status and outcome), GET /runs/:id/events (SSE; Last-Event-ID maps to the event seq, replay is at-least-once and consumers deduplicate on `replayed`), POST /runs/:id/external/:key (programmatic resolution, `by: 'external'`; a run that settled suspended in-process auto-resumes; a run not live in this process gets the documented offline append under a lease where the store is leasable, and resumes on a worker), GET /runs/:id/cost (the settled in-process CostReport, or the pure journal fold priced by the optional `priceUsd`). Authentication stays host middleware (docs/14, OQ-16).
  - `@rulvar/core`: the Engine interface gains the readonly `stores` accessor exposing the configured journal and transcript stores; exactly the instances createEngine received (or defaulted), no store contract widens.
  - `@rulvar/testing`: `createTestEngine` forwards the new `stores` accessor.

- a2a3243: M8-T02: createWorker, the queue shell (docs/02 section 8.3; FR-703), plus the two queue seams it stands on (docs/06 10.2 and docs/03 12.3, M8 entry amendment).

  - `@rulvar/cli`: `createWorker(engine, { store: LeasableStore, concurrency? })` leases resumable and suspended runs via acquire/renew/release with fencing epochs (renew cadence ttl/3; Appendix A reference ttl 60000 ms; concurrency default 1). A store without lease capability is a typed ConfigError at start, never a silent split-brain; leasing a store other than `engine.stores.journal` is equally a ConfigError. DEF-6 repeats at acquire: a journal outside the hashVersion window releases the lease and poisons the run for this worker. Stateless workers call bare `engine.resume` with the lease; unchanged suspended runs are skipped until their journal grows; queue semantics stay honestly at-least-once with deduplication by the journal. The OQ-21 residual (original in-process args are not journaled) is bridged by the optional `argsFor` hook.
  - `@rulvar/core`: `ResumeOptions.lease` carries the worker's lease through the kernel's single append site, so a stale writer's appends are rejected by the fencing epoch and never become visible (lease theft impossible by construction); bare `engine.resume(runId)` now falls back from the persisted CompiledWorkflow source to `defaults.workflows[workflowName]` (the registry the queue worker resolves through, docs/06 10.4); the Replayer accepts the lease option.

- f920013: M8-T03: the multi-process seam soak and the queue-failover-during-forced-finish cassette (the DEF-7 final cassette; docs/09 sections 6.9 and 6.10; docs/10 section 3.9 exit criteria).

  - `@rulvar/plan`: the public `runQueueFailoverDuringForcedFinish` cassette runner: worker A loses its lease strictly between the cap decision and the final wake; worker B reclaims with a bumped fencing epoch and rolls the forced finish forward. The stale writer's appends are rejected and invisible, exactly one cap decision exists, finalization is paid once. The LeasableStore is injected (`QueueFailoverDeps.makeStore`) so the package stays core-only; the replay test and the record script supply the reference SqliteStore.
  - `@rulvar/cli`: the multi-process-fencing-soak harness: two workers over one SqliteStore file with kill/failover across the suspension, plan-revision, and forced-finish boundaries; every round asserts zero split-brain and zero double pay. Worker hardening: a failed renew now frees the concurrency slot immediately (a stale run whose landings all reject may never settle; fencing, not the stale process's cooperation, protects the journal).
  - Repo: `cassettes/queue-failover-during-forced-finish.json` recorded and frozen (double-run agreement; `scripts/record-m8-cassettes.mjs`); the queue-mode limitation stays documented (no distributed cross-process rate limiter, EXC-14/OQ-17).

- ebc8101: M8-T04: the redaction and retention interim rules executed (docs/14 OQ-20 and OQ-22; docs/09 section 8 rewritten to the executed state; docs/03 12.4 and 12.8; docs/06 10.1 and 10.2 amendments).

  - `@rulvar/core`: the L0 SerializationHook (`createEngine({ serialization })`): redact/encrypt at the append/put boundaries, symmetric on load/get, applied by wrapping the stores so `Engine.stores` exposes the one policy point; kernel ordering fields are drift-checked with a loud ConfigError. Default key masking at the telemetry boundary: every emitted WorkflowEvent passes `maskSecrets` (provider keys, PATs, bearer tokens, JWTs, private-key blocks become `[masked-secret]`); opt out via `redaction: { maskEvents: false }`; never touches the journal. Retention: `TranscriptStore.delete(ref)` joins the SPI (missing ref is a no-op; InMemory and File stores implement it), `Engine.deleteRun(runId)` cascades blob deletion before the journal (no orphan transcripts), and `Engine.pruneRun(runId)` deletes checkpoint blobs of ok-terminal attempts that nothing else references (parked, cancelled, escalated, and hanging attempts keep theirs).
  - `@rulvar/cli`: `createServer` and `createWorker` take the opt-in `retention` predicate over RunMeta (the server applies it at terminal settles, the worker during sweeps under a brief lease); the OTel exporter masks string span attributes with the same policy, defense in depth over the already conservative attribute content policy.
  - `@rulvar/testing`: `createTestEngine` forwards `deleteRun`/`pruneRun`.

  - @rulvar/core@0.8.0

### 0.7.0

#### Minor Changes

- 10b45f1: M6-T11: the rulvar plan command and the M6 gating cassettes. `rulvar plan "<goal>" [--dry-run]` (the canonical grammar) loads @rulvar/planner DYNAMICALLY (the CLI's static dependency stays @rulvar/core; a missing install is a clear error), plans against the host-config engine, prints the accepted script plus its advisory diagnostics, and runs it in the worker sandbox unless --dry-run. The three docs/09 6.10 gating cassettes are recorded on the FakeAdapter and committed under the frozen-fixture lock with exported scenario builders shared by the recorder script and the replay tests: sandbox-determinism (two fresh runs of one CompiledWorkflow produce byte-identical normalized journals matching the cassette), planner-self-repair (the failing draft round-trips through the JSON-diagnostics repair, re-planning from the committed journal is free, and the accepted script executes deterministically in the sandbox), and orchestrator-crash-resume (the committed pre-crash journal plus boundary checkpoints resume with zero re-paid spawns, no duplicate spawn decisions, and byte-stable handles).

#### Patch Changes

- 9f000a7: Drop the @rulvar/planner peer declaration from the CLI: the plan command loads the planner DYNAMICALLY and reports a clear error when it is not installed, and a workspace peer dependency would major-cascade the whole fixed group on every planner bump under the changesets peer-dependents rule (0.6.0 would have released as 1.0.0 instead of 0.7.0).

### 0.6.0

#### Minor Changes

- fa05007: M5-T01 workflow registry and the @rulvar/cli base.

  - `@rulvar/core` gains the per-engine `WorkflowRegistry` type and
    `defaults.workflows` on createEngine (docs/06 section 10.4): an
    explicit first-class value, no module-level registry; shells resolve
    by-name runs against it (ctx.workflow's string form arrives M6, the
    queue worker M8).
  - Spec-conformance fix: the M4-T09 quality floors option moves from the
    createEngine top level to its canonical home `defaults.roleFloors`
    (docs/06 section 10.1). Update `createEngine({ floors })` call sites
    to `createEngine({ defaults: { roleFloors } })`.
  - `@rulvar/cli` ships its first real surface: the canonical grammar
    `rulvar run <file|name> [--args JSON] [--store PATH] [--budget-usd N]`,
    `rulvar resume <runId> [--args JSON] [--store PATH]`,
    `rulvar runs ls [--store PATH]`, `rulvar inspect &lt;runId&gt; [--store
PATH]` (no aliases), a line-oriented TUI progress renderer over the
    event stream, and interactive resolution of suspended approvals and
    externals (EOF leaves the run suspended, never errors). Engine
    assembly follows the host-config convention: `rulvar.config.mjs`
    default-exports `{ engineOptions?, workflows? }`, a workflow module
    may export `workflow`/`engineOptions`/`workflows`, and --store selects
    the JsonlFileStore directory (default `.rulvar`), so the CLI itself
    depends only on @rulvar/core. The `rulvar` bin is included; the
    resume/inspect grammar amendment (--args re-supply, --store symmetry)
    is recorded in docs/06 section 10.5.

- 9234dc8: M5-T03 cost reports. The CostReport builder moves to its own module
  (`engine/cost-report.ts`) and report totals become the LEDGER FOLD
  totals at settle: RunOutcome.usage and cost.totalUsd are computed from
  the journal's terminal entries (the same summation the kernel budget
  seed uses), so report totals equal ledger fold totals exactly, live and
  across resume, by construction. The new `costReportFromJournal(entries,
priceUsd)` is the pure fold for STORED runs: byModel and totals from
  terminal servedBy with abandoned subtrees contributing zero; phase,
  agentType, and role attribution are live-run facts that entries do not
  carry (byRole and the orchestrator block complete in M7 per DEF-7).
  Unpriced models keep surfacing, never as silent zeros. `rulvar inspect`
  gains the cost view (total, byModel, unpriced) over the config-assembled
  price function (table wins over caps.pricing), and live run output
  prints the byModel/byPhase buckets.
- 8a41656: M5-T07 RunProfile presets and M5-T08 OTel exporter.

  - `engine/run-profiles.ts`: `RUN_PROFILES` (fast/standard/deep/ultra) and
    `runProfile(name)` ship the presets as pure DATA, bundles of per-role
    effort hints, per-run concurrency, budget, permission preset, and
    spawn limits, with no functions and no named model strings (named
    strong defaults stay in the umbrella). They are never engine
    semantics: a source-scan test asserts the engine has zero branches
    keyed on profile names. `rulvar run --profile <name>` applies the
    chosen profile UNDER the host's own engine options (host always wins;
    the engine then sees only ordinary options), compiling the profile's
    permission preset into the engine deny/ask layers as data.
  - `@rulvar/cli` gains `toOtel(run, tracer)`: it maps a settled run's
    spanId tree 1:1 onto OpenTelemetry spans (run > phase > agent > tool >
    child), with rulvar.* and gen_ai.* attributes, start/end timestamps
    from the lifecycle events, and payload-only events attached as span
    events. Prompts, completions, and tool payloads are NEVER exported;
    replayed events never create duplicate spans. `@opentelemetry/api`
    ^1.9 is an optional peer dependency and the exporter is typed against
    a minimal structural TracerLike, so an absent OTel package never
    breaks the CLI.

#### Patch Changes

- 5c8865d: M5 exit criterion coverage: prove the CLI works end to end against
  SqliteStore, not only JsonlFileStore (docs/10, section 3.6). A host
  config that supplies a SqliteStore as `engineOptions.stores.journal` is
  honored by the CLI's engine assembly (JsonlFileStore is only the default
  fallback), so run/suspend, runs ls, resume, and inspect all round-trip
  against sqlite through the same command paths. Added as a CLI e2e test.

### 0.1.0

#### Minor Changes

- f4e2be9: M0 repo bootstrap (v0.1.0, docs/10-implementation-plan.md section "M0"):
  monorepo scaffold on the committed toolchain (pnpm 11 workspaces with
  catalogs, TypeScript 6.0, tsdown, Vitest 4, ESLint 9 flat config,
  Turborepo 2, changesets fixed mode, npm trusted publishing), the docs/
  canon as single source of truth, the L0 contracts skeleton in @rulvar/core,
  and the vendored dependencies (StandardSchemaV1/StandardJSONSchemaV1 types,
  the @cfworker/json-schema lineage validator subset, a first-party monotonic
  ULID). Placeholder scaffolds only: no public API ships in this release.

## @rulvar/compat

deliberate manual events, never lockstep bumps; this changelog is
maintained by hand.

### 0.1.0

- M2-T05: extraDerivers plumbing plus the synthetic hashVersion 0
  deriver for the reject-version-too-old cassette. No real profile has
  aged out of the support window yet.

## @rulvar/core

### 1.4.0

#### Minor Changes

- c4f563d: Production readiness fixes from the July 2026 full audit.

  - The `budgetUsd` ceiling now survives resume: the engine records it in `RunMeta.budgetUsd` and restores it on every resume, so the replayed spend counts against the original invocation's bound and `ResumeOptions` still exposes no way to raise it. Journals written before the field existed (or read through a store that drops optional `RunMeta` fields) resume uncapped, exactly as before; the conformance kit gains a round-trip check so custom stores cannot drop the field silently.
  - `spawn:rejected` and `resolution:applied` / `resolution:superseded` are now emitted: live admission rejections carry the rejection `code`, `agentType`, and the journaled decision `entryRef` (absent only for pre-admission config gates), and live resolution attempts report winning or losing the first-closing-wins fold. `spawn:admitted` now carries the decision `entryRef` and the admitting `verdict` arm. The `orchestrator:budget` union member now types the two payload shapes actually emitted; `journal:compat` stays declared but unemitted (the scan runs before a run's event stream exists) and its TSDoc says so.
  - `toOtel` implements real parent-child span nesting when `contextApi` and `setSpan` are passed; without them spans stay flat but attributed.

  - `'readonly'` isolation now compiles a deny rule for tools declaring risk `write` or `destructive` into the spawn's permission chain, exactly as the tools guide documents; read tools and other isolation modes are unaffected.
  - VCR `replay()` refuses a cassette recorded outside the engine's hashVersion support window (`[CURRENT-1, CURRENT]`) with a typed `ConfigError` instead of silently drifting; in-window cassettes replay as before.
  - `InMemoryStore` accepts `{ quiet: true }` to opt out of the durability warning, and the warning text now states the precise truth: nothing survives a process exit and cross-process resume is impossible (same-process resume of a kept instance works). `createTestEngine` constructs its store quietly, so the blessed offline tier no longer prints a misleading warning.
  - The bare `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` development warnings no longer blame workflow code for calls that originate in library internals (the engine's own retry jitter, provider SDKs): the retry jitter uses a natively captured `Math.random`, and the in-process guard skips callers that live under `node_modules`.
  - `rulvar run --profile` now applies the profile's per-role effort hints: entries in `defaults.routing` that carry no effort are seeded from `RunProfile.effortByRole` (an explicit host effort always wins; ladder entries and unrouted roles stay untouched).
  - `rulvar --help` documents the shipped `kb inbox` and `kb gate` subcommands.
  - The unscoped `rulvar` pointer package ships TypeScript declarations (`index.d.ts` with a `types` export condition), so strict TypeScript projects can import the bare name; the install smoke gate now packs and checks the pointer alongside the umbrella.

### 1.3.2

#### Patch Changes

- ddef383: Every published package now ships a README, so its npm page states what the package is, how it installs, and where the documentation lives (npm includes README.md in the tarball regardless of the files allowlist, so no manifest changes are involved; @rulvar/compat gains its README on its own next release). Alongside, the repository-level pages are refreshed to the current project state: the root README is rewritten around the never-pay-twice pitch with a runnable quickstart condensation and the full package table, CONTRIBUTING.md lists the complete PR gate set, the examples README drops retired-spec citations for live docs.rulvar.com links and documents the dogfood journal replay, and the pointer README gets the same treatment.

### 1.3.1

#### Patch Changes

- 7d1552e: Runtime message strings no longer cite the retired internal specification set: error and warning messages, validation issues, and the CLI help text drop the dangling `docs/NN, section ...` references, pointing at https://docs.rulvar.com pages where a pointer earns its place (the CLI help header, tool naming, toolset registries, bare resume). The umbrella package description sheds the naming-contingency note: the unscoped alias is published and owned. Three strings embedded in frozen recordings stay byte-identical on purpose (the no-progress abort reason and two testing-internal recorder strings), as does the byte-locked golden-fold fixture. Test-file comments lose their citations too; test titles are unchanged.

### 1.3.0

#### Minor Changes

- 7d1a287: ModelKnowledge phase 3, first slice (M12-T02, unlocked by the passed measured-value checkpoint): the kb_propose orchestrator tool and the quarantined modelObservations write path. PlanRunner registers kb_propose on explicit opt-in (PlanRunnerOptions.kbPropose, like any opt-in tool); its payload is tier-relative (the orchestrator never names a model) and the engine resolves the tier against the referenced lineage's declared ladder into the concrete KbProposal subject, validates that the tier has a journaled attempt and that evidence refs resolve to this run's decision entries, and journals the proposal as the observation_add ledger.op through the single-writer path. Quarantine is absolute: the ack is entryRef only, ledger_read withholds observation content behind a count (byte-stable for observation-free renders), worker prompts never see it, and nothing can commit during a run (the runtime handle has no write path by API shape); proposals reach the human gate only through the post-run LedgerExport. Core exports KbProposal, KbProposalTrigger and the typed model-free proposalStatement template. The kb-propose-quarantine cassette joins the frozen catalog (61 IDs).

### 1.2.0

#### Minor Changes

- 890f42c: The knowledge card gains the profile-evidence section (docs/05 section 4.3 as amended): eval-measured claims project onto the advertised spawn vocabulary, one line per concrete-model profile with a conservative weakness-over-strength fold across efforts, plus a fixed spawn-guidance line. FR-607 commits the card to feeding agentType choice at spawn, and the M12 checkpoint measured that tier-relative rows alone carry no agentType-actionable signal (criterion 2: equal quality, cost overhead, no steering). Ladder declarers and model-less profiles do not participate; the section renders only when at least one profile line exists, so every previously recorded card stays byte-identical; model names still never render.

#### Patch Changes

- 3bfaec0: A capped orchestrator dispatches its own agent with estCost equal to its effectiveCap, and the forced-finish agent with the finalize reserve (docs/07 section 12.2 as amended): layer 2 makes those the true admission worst cases. Without the hints the default reserve priced the model's full maxOutputTokens (about one dollar on strong tiers) and the commitment rode the whole ancestor chain for the orchestrator's lifetime, so small run ceilings sat at zero admission remainder and every child spawn died with a budget rejection. Found live by the M12 checkpoint: no orchestrated child was ever admitted under the case ceilings, and both A/B arms measured a self-solving orchestrator instead of agentType selection.
- 154507b: TSDoc and inline comments no longer cite the retired internal specification set (the pre-docs-site `docs/NN, section ...` references). The citations either became links to the public documentation at docs.rulvar.com or were dropped where the comment already carried the rule; traceability markers (DEF-n, XF-nn, FR-nnn, OQ-nn, W-nnn) are untouched. Comment-only change: no runtime behavior, no API shapes, and no runtime message strings were modified; the frozen golden-fold fixture is byte-identical.

### 1.1.0

#### Patch Changes

- d16b04a: Plain orchestrate treats ladder-declaring profiles as declaration-only (docs/07 section 10 as amended): the spawn vocabulary in the profile card advertises concrete profiles and lists declarers on a separate context line, and spawn_agent naming a declarer is rejected with a typed ConfigError before admission instead of dying later at wire resolution. Found live by the fifth M12 checkpoint run: the knowledge card praises ladder tiers by profile name, so the card-informed arm kept spawning the declarers and measured far below the uninformed baseline.

### 1.0.0

#### Major Changes

- 464ab6e: rulvar v1.0.0: the first published release. An embeddable TypeScript engine for durable, budget-bounded, testable multi-agent LLM workflows: an append-only journal with byte-deterministic replay and crash resume over JSONL or SQLite (multi-process workers with lease fencing), hermetic VCR cassettes gating CI through a frozen 60-cassette defect catalog, hard per-run USD ceilings with orchestrator sub-budgets, finalize reserves and admission control, adaptive orchestration (typed plan revisions with rebase, escalation protocols, model ladders, wake digests, lineage and reuse), ModelKnowledge phases 1 and 2 (the git-reviewed model-suitability claim store with TTL decay, eval-measured claims from matrix sweeps, canary fingerprints, and the one-rung-clamped verified layer), provider adapters for Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible and Google plus a Vercel AI SDK bridge, an eval framework, and the rulvar CLI (run, resume, runs, inspect, plan, kb). Licensed Apache-2.0. The six core SPI seams are frozen; ModelKnowledgeStore freezes with this release per docs/05. Ships the M9 through M11 scope together per the 2026-07-11 amendment to docs/12 section 2.

#### Minor Changes

- 0e0b569: M10 entry: the render budgets of docs/06 Appendix A are committed (the TBD-before-M10 rule) and wired as engine defaults; OQ-04 (the renderBudget measure) closes on the CHARACTER measure.

  - WakeDigest: 400 chars per outputSummary row, one exported constant (`WAKE_SUMMARY_RENDER_BUDGET_CHARS`) now serving both the distillation cap (adopted unchanged, the value frozen into every cassette since M6) and the digest render default of `renderBudgetChars`, which stays overridable per orchestration.
  - ledger_read render: 65536 chars over the serialized view via the new pure `boundLedgerRender` (exported with `LEDGER_RENDER_BUDGET_CHARS`): over budget, rows drop deterministically oldest-first (auto-derived joins before authored sections, the mission brief slices last) and every drop renders as a FLAGGED discrepancy line. The section caps stay the primary bound, so under default termination limits the belt never engages; all frozen fixtures are byte-identical.
  - KB card: 4096 chars, committed in docs and consumed by the M10-T03 card renderer.

- b28b7a3: M10-T01: the ModelKnowledgeStore SPI and the default file store (docs/05, sections "Data model" and "Commit discipline"). The engine-scoped, per-project, append-only claim store lands as a new SPI seam, a neighbor of JournalStore, freezing with knowledge-base phase 1 post-1.0 (never touching the six frozen core seams).

  - `ModelKnowledgeStore { current; commit(ops, expectedVersion) }` with CAS on the monotonic snapshot version, mirroring the lease fencing discipline; concurrent commits serialize through the retryable `KnowledgeCasError` and rebase. There is NO propose() method in the SPI at all, and the runtime handle type `ModelKnowledgeHandle = Pick<..., 'current'>` physically lacks commit (docs/05 security channels 2 and 3).
  - The full docs/05 claim data model as types: `ModelClaim` (subject with effort as part of identity, mandatory taskClass and evidence, TTL fields, append-only supersede), `GateRecord` (the human variant does not assemble without the attribution attestation), `ClaimOp`, `EvidenceRef` (entryRef is the journal seq), `KnowledgeSnapshot`. The `TaskClass` vocabulary upgrades from bare string to the docs/05 union (the six floor-aligned classes plus open extension), canonically resident with the knowledge SPI and re-exported by the floors module.
  - `FileModelKnowledgeStore` defaulting to `./rulvar.models.json`: git-diffable pretty JSON with atomic temp-plus-rename replace; append-only mechanics (supersede and archive flip status, never delete, preserving the audit trail); referential integrity as typed ConfigErrors; the empty snapshot (version 0) when no file exists.

- b53a89e: M10-T02: the editorial claim path, validated (docs/05, sections "Data model", "The human gate", "Grounding and decay"). The runtime enforcement the T01 types promise:

  - A gated op without the attribution attestation is now a RUNTIME error at commit, not only a type error: the human gate requires a non-empty ruledOut checklist over the docs/05 vocabulary, and the eval-confirmed gate rejects as reserved for v2.
  - The editorial path is the only committable path in phase 1: eval-measured claims and the metrics block reject until the M11 eval-committer identity ships (the validators already model the identity flag M11 will pass).
  - The active-claims cap holds at commit: 8 per (model, taskClass) by default (docs/06, Appendix A), configurable per store; supersede chains keep only the head active, so a supersede never grows the count.
  - Statement bounds (200 chars), mandatory evidence and taskClass, date coherence, and the asymmetric TTL table land as pure helpers: `claimExpiry` (eval 90/30, editorial 120/45 days by polarity) and `claimExpired` for the read-path filters of M10-T03.

- 4454175: M10-T03: the ModelKnowledge read path (docs/05, sections "Read path" and "Security"). kb_pinned and kb_repinned land, the card renders, and the whole feature is store-gated: an engine without `stores.modelKnowledge` writes no kb entries at all, so every existing journal and cassette stays byte-stable (zero added awaits on the off path).

  - `createEngine` accepts `stores.modelKnowledge`; the runtime holds ONLY the `current()` handle (commit is physically absent inside runs).
  - One read at run admission for orchestrate-role runs: the engine filters claims (active, unexpired, reachable through the run's declared ladders after the role-floor filter) and journals `kb_pinned { version, hash, cardText }` with the card bytes EMBEDDED, strictly before the first orchestrator turn. Resume and replay read the entry bytes and never touch the live store.
  - A fresh `kb_repinned` lands on every wait_for_events wake under the same filtering rules against a FRESH store read, so expired, stale, and archived claims never steer spawns after pauses; a mid-run store commit affects only subsequent pins.
  - `modelKnowledgeCard`: deterministic, two-layer, tier-relative, 4096-char budget (oldest notes withhold behind an explicit marker). The verified layer compiles EXCLUSIVELY from eval-measured claims (empty in phase 1) with the one-rung clamp; editorial notes render dated and explicitly marked, never compiled into a tier; the orchestrator never sees model names. The card docks into the spawn tool description beside the profile card.
  - OQ-11 closes: editorial notes render for every taskClass with no self-description suppression (the nameless tier-relative render already blunts the feared bias).
  - Two catalog cassettes (docs/09, new section 6.11): kb-pin-replay and kb-repin-expiry, recorded offline over a deterministic stub store with time-stable dates; the cassette-catalog CI job runs them.

- 6599ca8: M10-T05: the taskClass binding interim rule becomes the phase-1 resolution (docs/05, section "Phases and placement"; docs/14 OQ-12 CLOSED). The classification source is author declaration: the optional `taskClass` on AgentProfile, TaskSpec, and spawn_agent params; absence means unclassified and stores no literal string anywhere. Card recommendations never apply to unclassified spawns (in phase 1 no recommendation application exists at all; the M11 compiler inherits the rule as normative).

  - The plan dispatch now forwards the declared TaskSpec.taskClass onto the ExtensionDispatchSpec, completing the substrate: a declared class journals inside the spawn-admission decision (spawn_agent path) and the plan.revision spec of record (PlanRunner path), so M11 matrix sweeps and the recommendation compiler slice attempts by class from journals alone.
  - Byte-neutral: journals without declared classes are unchanged; floors stay profile-driven per docs/04.

- 6649e5f: M11-T01: the eval-committer identity activates eval-measured claims (docs/05, sections "Data model" and "Commit discipline", amended with the dedicated `eval-committer` GateRecord variant, distinct from the v2-reserved eval-confirmed proposal auto-gate).

  - Commit validation is now GATE-DRIVEN and the coherence square is schema-enforced in both directions: an eval-committer-gated op MUST carry class eval-measured, author kind eval-pipeline, and the metrics block; a human-gated op MUST NOT carry any of the three (a human-authored op with metrics keeps rejecting). Observational data never carries metrics and never auto-promotes.
  - `@rulvar/evals` ships the pipeline side: `evalMeasuredClaim` (the docs/05 TTL table applied by polarity: strength 90 days, weakness 30) and `commitEvalMeasured` with the documented CAS-rebase recipe against any ModelKnowledgeStore.

- fd2f83b: M11-T03: TTL and staleness (docs/05, section "Grounding and decay"). The decay module (`src/knowledge/decay.ts`) becomes the decay owner: the asymmetric TTL table (eval 90/30, editorial 120/45; inbox 14 days exported as a constant, reserved for M12) and `claimExpiry`/`claimExpired` move there with their names re-exported through the claims module unchanged.

  - The re-measurement queue lands as documented: `remeasureQueue(claims, at)` is JUST a status filter over expired, still-active eval-measured claims (nothing archives them: the next sweep re-measures the subjects); `ttlState` feeds maintenance views.
  - Archive-never-delete maintenance: `archiveDeprecatedModelOps(claims, models)` produces archive ops (reason `deprecated`) for every live claim of a deprecated model; historical runs keep their audit trail.
  - Expiry stays enforced at every pin AND repin through the M10-T03 read-path filter; the acceptance test drives the same filter across the boundary clock: an expired claim stops influencing the card at the next pin or repin.

- 01d6b2d: M11-T04: modelEpoch capture and the canary fingerprint (docs/05, section "Grounding and decay"; OQ-06 CLOSED with the committed design).

  - Core: `modelEpochOf`/`capsHashOf` build the honestly coarse epoch signal (registry version, pricing version, caps hash; silent alias re-pointing stays a documented uncaught case absent probes). The ClaimOp union gains `mark_stale` (docs/05 amended): section 6 requires status stale at fingerprint drift and the closed op set could not produce it; active flips to stale, already-stale is an idempotent noop, terminals never revive.
  - Evals: `canaryFingerprint(engine, probes)` runs the FIXED caller-versioned probe set sequentially through the ordinary engine and hashes NFC-normalized, whitespace-collapsed outputs (the probe count prefixes the hash so probe-set edits never collide with drift). `flipStaleOnCanaryDrift` flips the model's active eval-measured claims whose recorded fingerprint differs, in one CAS-rebased command; claims without a baseline stay untouched. Sweeps stamp the epoch per pool member via `modelEpochFor`.

- 9a20dbb: M11-T06: the verified-layer compiler goes public (docs/05, sections "Read path" and "Composition with the model layer"). `compileVerifiedLayer(claims, ladders)` compiles start-tier recommendations per (ladder, taskClass) EXCLUSIVELY from eval-measured claims with the one-rung clamp (the price of any false belief stays one rung; ties hold the default and compile nothing; editorial claims never compile); the card renders from it and future consumers read the structured rows, never the card text. Floors and ModelCaps stay hard; budget is touched only through the existing admission path.

  Property-tested over seeded random snapshots: no compiled recommendation ever exceeds one rung of displacement or leaves the ladder, editorial-only snapshots compile to nothing, and compilation is deterministic. The M11 OQ sweep rides along in docs/14: OQ-09 closes with the defined M12 gate criteria (A/B sweeps, rung and agentType selection against the no-card baseline); OQ-07, OQ-08, and OQ-10 carry honestly (their triggers cannot fire while every release is founder-deferred).

- 0fbe7ea: M9-T04 (part 1): the DEF-2 and DEF-3 catalog rows deferred at M7 (docs/09 sections 6.2 and 6.3; docs/10 M9 row "Complete catalog green in one CI run"), plus the producers and liveness fixes the rows exposed.

  - Nine new frozen cassettes with public runners and byte-for-byte replay tests: combined-loop-descent, config-drift-resume, class-storm-single-turn, oscillation-bounded, race-timeout-vs-live (DEF-2); respawn-preserves-counter, reworded-lessons-collide, stall-streak-classes-and-pinning, legacy-journal-resume (DEF-3). The class and race rows additionally round-trip their frozen bytes through BOTH reference stores (JsonlFileStore and SqliteStore) with identical loads, per the store-independence rule.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: the class-level escalation decision producer lands (docs/07 6.5): two or more same-kind reports resolved by ONE revision merge into ONE escalation-decision entry with per-lineage `debits` rows and resolvedBy 'class'; a denied per-lineage debit degrades the group to single-target decisions so denial semantics stay per report. The folds already consumed this form; single-target behavior and all existing cassette bytes are unchanged.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: `termination:config-drift` now actually fires on resume when a live termination knob diverges from the journaled `termination.init` (the journal wins, the divergence is reported per field; docs/07 11.2). Events are never journaled, so frozen cassettes are unaffected.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: a `retry` escalation decision re-opens the node AND clears its stale dispatch handle; previously the re-opened node sat ready forever while the scheduler skipped it (the re-dispatch liveness gap behind Flavor B defaultDecision retry).
  - `@rulvar/plan`: `lesson_add` keys once (docs/07 9.2): a repeated add with the same content key acks the recorded lesson instead of appending a duplicate; re-executed-turn recovery is unchanged.
  - `@rulvar/core`: an extension dispatch whose agent dies BEFORE its root entry lands now surfaces the underlying failure loudly to the dispatching caller instead of hanging the dispatch await forever (the pre-root cousin of the stale-writer liveness rule). Healthy paths and replays are byte- and timing-identical.
  - Known residual, unchanged: repeated Flavor B suspensions on ONE re-opened node dedup onto the first suspension's decision key; the recorded cassettes route around it and the at-cap immediate-resolution flavor rows stay with M9-T04's later parts.

- ebe0abc: M9-T04 (part 2): the six DEF-5 catalog cassettes (docs/09 section 6.5; docs/03 section 9), plus the reuse-producer completions the rows forced.

  - Six new frozen cassettes with public runners and byte-for-byte replay tests: oscillation-full-reuse (escalated-terminal donor, shared full link, by-ref root, reclaimedUsdAtLink carries the donor spend), graft-partial-subtree (a three-rung limit ladder severed mid-top-rung grafts exclusively; the completed rung attempts forward-match through the scope alias and only the interrupted rung reruns live, exactly once), crash-between-link-and-root (cut strictly between the durable node.link and the by-ref root; the resume rolls forward with zero repayment), oscillation-guard-trip (the third re-add at maxOscillationsPerKey 2 rejects osc_guard with the embedded verdict and the run closes non-HITL), worktree-disposed-degrade (an unpinned worktree graft donor degrades to a fresh admit with DedupNote graft_unsafe; reuse_full stays allowed for a worktree donor with a terminal root), claim-exclusivity-and-chain (two identical adds in ONE revision: the first grafts exclusively, the second degrades donor_active; the severed grafted node becomes the chain head and the third add drains the chain transitively; oscillationCount reaches 2).
  - `@rulvar/core` (docs/03 9.3/9.6 producer completions, folds and bytes of existing journals unchanged): evaluateReuse now skips exclusively-claimed donors (first-wins) and degrades to a fresh admit with the documented `donor_active` reason when every candidate is captured; a severed grafted node inherits its captured link's chain (ancestry plus chain-tail graft eligibility), so the next add links to the chain head and drains transitively; agent dispatch roots record their resolved isolation (`value.isolation`, only when not 'none') so the DedupIndex worktree rules can read it from the journal.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: exclusive captures are first-wins WITHIN one revision too: the second identical add of the same revision degrades to `donor_active` instead of double-claiming the donor.
  - All fifteen M9 cassettes re-record byte-identically under the double-run agreement; the nine part-1 fixtures are untouched by the producer changes. fixtures.sha256 covers 50 frozen files.

- a3079d0: M9-T04 (part 3): the six DEF-8 catalog cassettes plus the DEF-7 reserve-survives-run-exhaustion row (docs/09 sections 6.7 and 6.8), with the roll-forward and reserve producers the rows exposed.

  - Seven new frozen cassettes with public runners and byte-for-byte replay tests: revise-racing-defaultDecision (the mandatory stale-wake trio dropping dep_already_resolved with blockingRef, node_escalated, node_already_done in ONE revision), crash-after-append-before-effects (the pre-effects kill point; both children spawn live exactly once on resume and the request-only cancel lands on the redispatched branch), amend-vs-running-then-cancel-add, intra-revision-self-conflict (sequential intra-revision semantics), bad-base-streak-terminates (three fabricated-base all-dropped entries then the non-HITL guards fallback), park-races-child-completion (parkRequested extinguished by the child-result transition, no park retention), and reserve-survives-run-exhaustion (adds that would invade the committed finalize reserve drop admission_denied inside the revision outcomes; the forced finish executes FROM the reserve and closes the run ok).
  - `@rulvar/plan`: the idempotent plan_revise recovery path now also re-lands request-only cancels and parks by aborting the redispatched mid-flight branch; previously the crash-after-append-before-effects roll-forward left the cancelled branch running forever.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: an accepted escalation resolution records the node's done reference (doneRefs), so a later waive_dep against the resolved dependency drops dep_already_resolved with the blockingRef pointing at the resolving reference, exactly like a child-result transition.
  - `@rulvar/core`: the forced finish now RELEASES the finalize reserve as it begins (releaseFinalizeReserve): the reserve stops subtracting from the admission remainder at the moment it is being spent, or the finalize agent could never draw the money reserved for it under a tight run ceiling. Admissions stay frozen past the cap, so nothing else can take it. Cap behavior under unlimited ceilings (all existing cassettes) is byte-identical.
  - All 22 M9 cassettes re-record byte-identically under the double-run agreement; fixtures.sha256 covers 57 frozen files.

- 596a39b: The project is renamed to rulvar (the founder decision of 2026-07-11 closing OQ-24; the official domain is rulvar.com). Every package moves to the @rulvar scope (the umbrella is @rulvar/rulvar, the ESLint plugin is eslint-plugin-rulvar), the CLI binary is `rulvar`, the config convention is rulvar.config.mjs, the knowledge store default is rulvar.models.json, the default journal directory is .rulvar, engine warnings use the RULVAR_ prefix, and the orchestrator workflow name is rulvar-orchestrate. Because journaled bytes embed the workflow name and content keys, the entire frozen catalog (60 cassettes and the dogfood journals) was re-recorded under the new name and re-frozen; the turbo lint task now orders after upstream builds (a latent race the rename surfaced). Nothing was ever published under the former name, so no consumer migration exists.

### 0.9.0

#### Minor Changes

- 84f94d4: The v0.9.0 BREAKING release notes (M8 server and queue; the flagged BREAKING sections of the pre-1.0 convention, docs/12 registry).

  BREAKING: TranscriptStore gains the REQUIRED `delete(ref)` method (docs/03 12.4; the OQ-20 interim rule executed at M8-T04: retention is impossible without blob deletion, and `JournalStore.delete` alone would orphan every transcript). How it fails: third-party TranscriptStore implementations stop compiling against the widened SPI. Migration: implement `delete(ref)`; deleting a missing ref MUST be a no-op, never an error; the cascade over a run's blobs stays ENGINE-side (`Engine.deleteRun`), never a store obligation. The shipped InMemoryTranscriptStore and FileTranscriptStore already implement it.

  BREAKING: the Engine interface gains required members `stores`, `deleteRun`, and `pruneRun` (docs/06 10.2; the M8 seam and retention amendments: the shells read the run picture through the engine's stores, and retention needs the cascade and the checkpoint pruning as first-class engine operations). How it fails: custom Engine implementations and structural Engine test doubles stop compiling; ordinary consumers of `createEngine` are unaffected, and `ResumeOptions.lease` stays additive-optional. Migration: expose the configured stores and delegate `deleteRun`/`pruneRun` to the underlying engine (the pattern in `@rulvar/testing`'s `createTestEngine`).

- 65c7b2c: M8-T01: createServer, the HTTP shell (docs/02 section 8.2; FR-702), plus the Engine.stores seam it stands on (docs/06 10.2, M8 entry amendment).

  - `@rulvar/cli`: `createServer({ engine, workflows })` returns `{ fetch(req: Request): Promise<Response> }` with the five canonical routes: POST /runs (start a registered workflow), GET /runs/:id (status and outcome), GET /runs/:id/events (SSE; Last-Event-ID maps to the event seq, replay is at-least-once and consumers deduplicate on `replayed`), POST /runs/:id/external/:key (programmatic resolution, `by: 'external'`; a run that settled suspended in-process auto-resumes; a run not live in this process gets the documented offline append under a lease where the store is leasable, and resumes on a worker), GET /runs/:id/cost (the settled in-process CostReport, or the pure journal fold priced by the optional `priceUsd`). Authentication stays host middleware (docs/14, OQ-16).
  - `@rulvar/core`: the Engine interface gains the readonly `stores` accessor exposing the configured journal and transcript stores; exactly the instances createEngine received (or defaulted), no store contract widens.
  - `@rulvar/testing`: `createTestEngine` forwards the new `stores` accessor.

- a2a3243: M8-T02: createWorker, the queue shell (docs/02 section 8.3; FR-703), plus the two queue seams it stands on (docs/06 10.2 and docs/03 12.3, M8 entry amendment).

  - `@rulvar/cli`: `createWorker(engine, { store: LeasableStore, concurrency? })` leases resumable and suspended runs via acquire/renew/release with fencing epochs (renew cadence ttl/3; Appendix A reference ttl 60000 ms; concurrency default 1). A store without lease capability is a typed ConfigError at start, never a silent split-brain; leasing a store other than `engine.stores.journal` is equally a ConfigError. DEF-6 repeats at acquire: a journal outside the hashVersion window releases the lease and poisons the run for this worker. Stateless workers call bare `engine.resume` with the lease; unchanged suspended runs are skipped until their journal grows; queue semantics stay honestly at-least-once with deduplication by the journal. The OQ-21 residual (original in-process args are not journaled) is bridged by the optional `argsFor` hook.
  - `@rulvar/core`: `ResumeOptions.lease` carries the worker's lease through the kernel's single append site, so a stale writer's appends are rejected by the fencing epoch and never become visible (lease theft impossible by construction); bare `engine.resume(runId)` now falls back from the persisted CompiledWorkflow source to `defaults.workflows[workflowName]` (the registry the queue worker resolves through, docs/06 10.4); the Replayer accepts the lease option.

- ebc8101: M8-T04: the redaction and retention interim rules executed (docs/14 OQ-20 and OQ-22; docs/09 section 8 rewritten to the executed state; docs/03 12.4 and 12.8; docs/06 10.1 and 10.2 amendments).

  - `@rulvar/core`: the L0 SerializationHook (`createEngine({ serialization })`): redact/encrypt at the append/put boundaries, symmetric on load/get, applied by wrapping the stores so `Engine.stores` exposes the one policy point; kernel ordering fields are drift-checked with a loud ConfigError. Default key masking at the telemetry boundary: every emitted WorkflowEvent passes `maskSecrets` (provider keys, PATs, bearer tokens, JWTs, private-key blocks become `[masked-secret]`); opt out via `redaction: { maskEvents: false }`; never touches the journal. Retention: `TranscriptStore.delete(ref)` joins the SPI (missing ref is a no-op; InMemory and File stores implement it), `Engine.deleteRun(runId)` cascades blob deletion before the journal (no orphan transcripts), and `Engine.pruneRun(runId)` deletes checkpoint blobs of ok-terminal attempts that nothing else references (parked, cancelled, escalated, and hanging attempts keep theirs).
  - `@rulvar/cli`: `createServer` and `createWorker` take the opt-in `retention` predicate over RunMeta (the server applies it at terminal settles, the worker during sweeps under a brief lease); the OTel exporter masks string span attributes with the same policy, defense in depth over the already conservative attribute content policy.
  - `@rulvar/testing`: `createTestEngine` forwards `deleteRun`/`pruneRun`.

### 0.8.0

#### Minor Changes

- 85d55cf: The v0.8.0 BREAKING release notes (M7 adaptive orchestration full; the flagged BREAKING minor of the pre-1.0 convention, docs/12 registry).

  BREAKING: the unified `AdmitVerdict` union is extended with the reuse verdicts (`reuse_full`, `admit_graft`) and the new reject codes (`termination_exhausted`, `ladder_exceeds_frozen`, `lineage_exhausted`, `lineage_busy`, `osc_guard`) (DEF-5). How it fails: exhaustive switches over the verdict kind or reject code in custom shells and admission SPI extensions stop compiling. Migration: add branches for the new arms; reject-code switches should route unknown codes to their generic-denial path.

  BREAKING: reuse-by-reference is the DEFAULT (DEF-5). A byte-identical `add_task` after a cancel or abandon no longer re-executes the subtree: the result returns by reference (`reuse_full`) or continues from the paid prefix (`admit_graft`). How it fails: changed semantics; runs that relied on re-execution against a changed world observe referenced results instead. This is the only intentional change of visible semantics in the pre-1.0 line. Migration: set `reuse.enabled: false` on the admission config, or `fresh: true` on the specific `add_task`.

  BREAKING: the config key `maxEscalationsPerNode` is renamed to `maxEscalationsPerLogicalTask` (XF-10): escalations count per logical task across respawns via the lineage chain. How it fails: a typed `ConfigError` naming the new key rejects the old one. Migration: rename the key; the default stays 2.

  BREAKING: the plan-size-scaled revision budget option is removed without deprecation (DEF-2). `maxRevisionsPerRun` is an absolute, non-replenishable counter (default 32) debited by exactly 1 per journaled `plan_revise`; nothing increments it. How it fails: the removed option is rejected at config validation. Migration: size `maxRevisionsPerRun` directly.

  BREAKING: `plan_revise` result and error schemas widen (rebase outcomes, embedded admissions, `revisionUnitsRemaining`) and `WakeDigest` gains the MANDATORY `termination` field beside `planHash`, `budget`, and `reuse` (DEF-2/DEF-8). How it fails: schemaHash and toolsetHash of orchestrator scopes change, so VCR cassettes recorded over orchestrator turns invalidate. Migration: re-record affected cassettes; consumers of the digest type add the new mandatory blocks (all-zero outside PlanRunner).

  BREAKING: B0, the run budget ceiling, is immutable after start (DEF-2): no API, including HITL decisions, can top it up. How it fails: code that mutated the run budget mid-run or expected an HITL top-up hits a typed runtime error; overshoot stays bounded by one turn per in-flight agent. Migration: size the ceiling at start; use the orchestrator cap and the finalize reserve (DEF-7) for graceful degradation instead of top-ups.

  BREAKING: PlanRunner requires a resolvable orchestrator cap (DEF-7). `orchestratePlanned` with no run USD ceiling and no explicit `budget.capUsd`, or with `effectiveCap < finalizeReserve`, refuses to start with a typed `OrchestratorCapConfigError` before any LLM call. Migration: pass `budget: { capUsd }` (or run under a USD ceiling and rely on `capFraction`, default 0.2; up to 1.0 opts out explicitly with a telemetry warning).

- b88c9e3: M7-T02: lineage LogicalTaskId (DEF-3). New `src/journal/lineage.ts`: `LogicalTaskId`/`LineageRelation`/`LineageRef`/`SpawnLineage`, `AttemptOutcomeClass`, `LineageStats`, `SpawnLineageOpt`; approach signatures (`normalizeApproachTag`, `approachSigCoarse`, `approachSigOf`, `canonicalIsolationTag`, sigVersion 1) with prompt prose excluded by construction; `EscalationLimits` with the committed defaults (maxEscalationsPerLogicalTask 2, maxAttemptsPerLogicalTask 8) and a validator that rejects the pre-rename `maxEscalationsPerNode` with a migration hint (XF-10); `LineageIndex`, the incremental pure counter fold (attemptsUsed / escalationsUsed under first-closing-wins and class-decision rules / stallStreak with class skips and resets / approaches grouping), pinnable to a snapshot seq, with deterministic `legacy:` contentHash LTIDs canonized onto journals written before lineage existed (random ULIDs on replay are forbidden). AdmissionController: `AdmitSpec` widens (`lineage: SpawnLineageOpt`, `approach`, `ancestry`, `signature`), `evaluateLineage` enforces the single-live-attempt invariant (`lineage_busy`) and monotonic attempt consumption (`lineage_exhausted`) strictly BEFORE the carrying decision entry is appended, and every non-reject decision now embeds the computed `SpawnLineage` value block reused byte-exact on replay. `ctx.agent` and `ctx.workflow` gain `lineage`/`approach` options; a ctx.agent declaration journals one spawn-admission decision entry before dispatch and recovers it on resume without re-minting. `budgetDefaults.lineage` configures the limits engine-wide.
- f3c4613: M7-T03: TerminationAccount and the termination lemma (DEF-2). New `src/journal/termination.ts`: the frozen `TerminationLimits` vector (V0 32, S0 128, E0 2, D0, kMax from the profile-registry snapshot, B0 immutable, orchestratorCapUsd and finalizeReserveUsd per XF-09) with a validator rejecting the pre-rename `maxEscalationsPerNode` (XF-10); the debit-only `TerminationAccount` (no credit operation exists by construction) with per-resource debits embedding balance-after, atomic NEW-lineage allocation (E0 plus K_l minus 1 rungs) on the spawn debit, strictly monotone rung indices, and the `debit()` surface that writes `termination.denied` strictly BEFORE resolving an underflow; the variant function Phi with `phiInitialOf` (V0 + C by S0, C = E0 + kMax); `buildTerminationInitValue` / `readTerminationInit` for the `termination.init` entry; `foldTermination`, the replay-strict recomputation that rebuilds the account from init, asserts every embedded balance (revisionUnitsAfter, spawnUnitsAfter, escalationUnitsAfter, rungIndexAfter/rungsRemainingAfter) at exactly the diverging entry, debits class-level decision arrays once per lineage, counts timeout defaultDecision resolutions once under first-closing-wins, and collects denials for zero-live-call re-issue; `terminationConfigDrift` (the journal always wins). AdmissionController gains `bindTermination`: under a bound account every admitted spawn of any origin debits one spawnUnit atomically with its decision entry (spawnUnitsAfter becomes the account balance), a declared ladder longer than the frozen kMax rejects with `ladder_exceeds_frozen`, and exhaustion rejects with `termination_exhausted`; `AdmitSpec.ladderLength` and the recorded `AdmissionDecision.ladderLength` feed the fold. The closed AdaptiveEvents catalog (docs/09 section 1.4) joins WorkflowEventBody, including termination:debit / termination:denied / termination:config-drift.
- a41c20f: M7-T05: PlanRunner scheduling and toolset. Core gains the PUBLIC orchestrator extension seam (docs/02 section 4 seam-sufficiency: orchestration packages build exclusively from the public API): `OrchestrateOptions.extension` hosts an `OrchestratorExtension` with boot strictly before the orchestrator's first agent entry, extension tools appended to the mode (c) toolset, an activity hook running after every child settlement strictly before wake evaluation, quiescence participation (nothing running AND nothing ready), digest extras, wake observation, prompt lines, and an `OrchestratorExtensionIO` exposing total-order appends into extension-owned scopes, the journal snapshot, the single admission point, explicit-scope child dispatch through the ordinary ctx.agent path (plan/NodeId sub-accounts open beside the orchestrator account), settled lookups, cancel, ULID minting, and telemetry. `outputSchemaRef`/`toolsetRef` now RESOLVE against the new `defaults.schemas` and `defaults.toolsets` engine registries (unknown names stay typed tool errors); `TerminationAccount.bindDeniedWriter` binds I/O onto fold-rebuilt accounts. @rulvar/plan ships `planRunner(options)` and `orchestratePlanned(engine, goal, opts)`: boot writes `termination.init` (frozen limits with kMax and the profile-registry snapshot hash) strictly before the first scheduling entry and binds the account into admission; plan_view renders the pinned pure fold (plan state, per-node LineageStats, the TerminationAccount snapshot) at the last delivered WakeDigest, with digestSeq 0 seeded as the empty-plan bootstrap snapshot; plan_revise (normative docs/07 4.7 schema) debits one revisionUnit per journaled revision (underflow writes termination.denied first), evaluates the committed rebase at the fold head, appends ONE plan.revision strictly before effects, schedules newly-ready nodes under plan/NodeId scopes, lands cancel requests, re-issues idempotently on re-executed turns (roll-forward), and emits plan:revised plus termination:debit; the engine (never the model) schedules ready nodes and journals ready-to-running and terminal transitions as plan.decision entries whose terminal transitions extinguish pending flags; quiescence completes (nothing running and nothing ready). The end-to-end revise-mid-run shape and a full crash-resume with zero live calls and no duplicate entries are covered by integration tests against the public engine API.
- f4e70be: M7-T07: reuse-by-reference (DEF-5). Core: new `journal/reuse.ts` with the rich `DonorRef` (replacing the M6 seq placeholder inside the closed AdmitVerdict union), `GraftBoot`, `DedupNote`, `ReuseConfig`, `NodeLinkValue` and its content identity (`nodeLinkKey` over {kind, spawnKey, donorScope, targetNodeId}), the `DedupIndex` pure fold (severed roots become donor candidates when their pre-abandon effective status is not error, memoized failures excluded, exclusive claims resolve first-wins, plan-node scopes sweep their own branch payments, unpinned worktree donors degrade), `evaluateReuse` with the four-outcome verdict table (reuse_full | admit_graft | fresh-with-note | reject osc_guard at the link count), and the abandoned-spend ledger fold (abandonedUsd/reclaimedUsd/netLostUsd, per-key oscillation counts). The kernel matcher gains scope-prefix aliasing (docs/03 9.5): `registerAlias` merges donor-scope candidates into the target scope in journal order at every nested level, and the alias disposition bypasses the abandon overlay so donor entries regain their pre-abandon status ONLY through the alias (the standalone old scope stays skipped); a dangling donor root through the alias IS the graft frontier (rerun-dangling continues from the donor checkpoint). `AbandonAttempt` carries logicalTaskId (XF-04); the extension IO gains `abandonBranch`, `registerAlias`, and `priceUsd`. Plan: PlanRunner wires the DedupIndex at the fold head under the PlanWriteLock into the rebase dedup hook (transforms embed the verdict, the donor descriptor, and the placement into the revision entry), applies the per-SpawnKey osc_guard rejection, attaches DedupNotes to fresh admits, compiles applied cancel_task (and cancel-landed) into severing abandon entries with lineage attribution, lands node.link entries and by-ref roots in the mandatory write order with idempotent roll-forward, registers aliases (rebuilt by fold at boot), completes full-linked nodes by reference through an engine decision instead of a dispatch, debits a spawnUnit per reuse link, and renders the abandoned-spend view in plan_view (pinned) and the WakeDigest extras; `PlanRunnerOptions.reuse` carries the docs/03 9.9 config.
- 75d1646: M7-T08: park and unpark. Core: the internal boot-checkpoint channel lets a FRESH dispatch boot from a retained transcript checkpoint (`ExtensionDispatchSpec.bootCheckpointRef`; dangling redispatch checkpoints take precedence), serving park/unpark continuation and the DEF-5 graft boot. Plan: new `park.ts` with the `PinLedger` fold (live pins counted from abandon entries carrying retainWorktree, park pinning and DEF-5 retention SHARE `maxPinnedWorktrees`, default 4), `parkDispositionOf` (checkpoints always retained; worktrees pinned only under capacity, overflow keeps the checkpoint but drops the tree), and `unparkPlacementOf` (continuation from the retained checkpoint; restart when no checkpoint exists or a worktree-isolated node lost its tree: silent resume against a fresh tree is impossible). PlanRunner lands parks at the turn boundary: a park-requested running child is aborted, the `park-landed` plan.decision transitions running to parked carrying the checkpoint anchor (set_node_status gains the optional checkpointRef field, applied by the fold), the branch is severed with retainCheckpoint plus retainWorktree per the pin disposition, the dispatch slot frees for the unpark, and node:parked emits. unpark_task applies with the embedded admission: a previously dispatched branch is a lineage rebirth (relation 'unpark-restart' continuing the node's LTID), while a never-started parked node resumes scheduling without consuming an attempt; the unparked dispatch boots from `checkpointRefFor(runId, anchor)` on the continuation path and restarts otherwise. The park-unpark integration test drives the full shape deterministically (one paid tool turn, park inside the second turn, unpark continuation whose booted history carries the paid turn) plus the pin-cap overflow and placement rows as units.
- 0627413: M7-T10: ModelLadder full (docs/07 section 10; docs/04 section 12; FR-119/FR-313). Core: ladders now RESOLVE through the chain (`canonicalizeLadder` validates the declaration once, FR-119 undeclared-judge-rung ConfigError included, and resolves every rung's effort explicitly; `ladderRungChoice` yields the concrete per-rung ModelChoice; a higher concrete layer shadows a lower ladder and vice versa; a ladder that WINS wire resolution stays a typed ConfigError since rung attempts always carry a concrete override). `ladderLengthOf` reads the normative declaration points (profile `model: { ladder }` or the loop-role routing entry). `foldTermination` debits the rung RESPAWN's embedded admission on raising ladder verdicts (docs/07 11.3 b). New per-engine mechanical gate registry `defaults.gates` (`MechanicalGateProfile` over AgentResult.artifacts). The extension seam gains `io.random` (journaled ctx.random for spot-checks), `io.gates`, and dispatch fields `model` (the concrete rung resolution entering the attempt's identity hash), `memoizeOutcome`, and inline `schema` for the engine-synthesized judge. Plan: new `ladder.ts` plus the PlanRunner ladder driver: rung attempts are ordinary agent scopes on the concrete rung model with rung caps binding (tier N+1 = new content key = one live attempt, all sharing the LTID via relation `rung-retry` registered from the raising verdict's `nextAttempt`); triggers classify typed (error, limit, schema-exhausted, no-progress first-class via the abort class, verify-failed from gates only); acceptance gates run per ok attempt in declaration order with journaled `gate-verdict` decisions (mechanical registry profiles, judge on a declared rung >= the executing rung or explicit override with a forced verdict schema and derived identity, spot-check selection strictly via the journaled draw); every ladder verdict is a decision entry computed once live and recovered by content key, so folds consume only journaled values; a denied respawn writes `termination.denied` strictly before the fallback lands; an ok attempt whose acceptance fails with no raise left lands `failed`, never `done`. Mid-flight resume redispatches running nodes through forward matching (dangling attempts continue, settled ones replay instantly): the half-escalated-ladder shape resumes without repaying completed rungs, proven by the truncated-journal test.
- 55c0f87: M7-T11: EscalationProtocol completion (docs/07 section 6; DEF-2/3/4). Core: Flavor B now REQUIRES an explicit `deadlineMs` (the knob has no engine default per the frozen Appendix A row; a flavor B spawn without it is a typed ConfigError before any LLM call); SpawnRecord captures the dispatch's escalation flavor and the WakeDigest escalations block reports it (a flavor B report reaching the digest is already decided by the DEF-4 winner). Plan: new `escalation.ts` with the authoritative `escalation-decision` entry contract (decide-once per report by content key; `countsAgainstLimit` derived from the report kind, XF-06; the counting debit atomic with the append embedding `escalationUnitsAfter`; a DENIED debit writes `termination.denied` strictly before and flips the entry to `capExceeded` with `countsAgainstLimit: false`, so the cap yields the flagged decision plus the final report, never a bare limit, and the folds stay replay-strict). PlanRunner completes the decision flow: the `cancel_task` revision transform on an escalated node lands the verdict `cancel` decision, the `resolve_escalation` plan.decision (origin `escalation-live`), and the severing abandon strictly after the revision append; a settled Flavor B suspension's DEF-4 winner (timeout `defaultDecision` by `timeout`, a live decision, or a class fan-out) is absorbed into the authoritative entry (origins `escalation-default`/`escalation-class`) and the fate applies through the single applier (retry re-opens the node in place with the journaled `amendedPrompt`/`startTier` honored at re-dispatch, accept closes the paid partial result done, cancel closes cancelled, decompose leaves the node escalated while the proposed children enter through `spawn_admitted` ops with FRESH lineages and embedded admissions debiting spawn units through the decision entry).
- fd33871: M7-T12: orchestrator cap and finalize reserve (DEF-7; docs/07 section 12). BREAKING for PlanRunner runs (v0.8.0 registry, docs/12): `orchestratePlanned` now REQUIRES a resolvable orchestrator cap; a run with no USD ceiling and no explicit `budget.capUsd`, or with `effectiveCap < finalizeReserve`, refuses to start with a typed `OrchestratorCapConfigError` BEFORE the first LLM call and before any journal entries (an uncapped orchestrator was precisely the defect; `capFraction` up to 1.0 opts out explicitly). `effectiveCapUsd = min(capUsd, capFraction x runCeiling)`, default fraction 0.2. The engine writes ONE `orchestrator_budget_reserve` decision entry strictly after `termination.init` and strictly before the orchestrator's first agent entry, freezing the cap and the finalize reserve (explicit, or `finalizeTurns` x the deterministic per-turn estimate) in absolute dollars, recovered by content key on resume and never re-evaluated. The reserve registers on the orchestrator account AND the run root (kept separate from committedReserve; the admission block checks add it), so no spawn ever eats the finalization money. At the pre-wake soft boundary (`orchSpent + turnEstimate > effectiveCap - finalizeReserve`) the engine writes exactly ONE `orchestrator_budget_cap` decision strictly before any effects (an in-flight latch closes the wake-ordinal race): the plan freezes for adaptation but not for work (the rebase context `frozen` flag drops every op `plan_frozen` while admitted nodes run to completion), all wake triggers except quiescence disarm, and the orchestrator unwinds to the reserved FINAL wake: a fresh agent entry on the restricted single-`finish` toolset with a `finalizeTurns` limit, paid from the reserve; success yields outcome `ok` with `forcedFinish` marked in the CostReport. If the final finish fails, `orchestrator_finalize_fallback` journals and the engine SYNTHESIZES a deterministic partial result by pure fold with zero LLM calls; the run ends `exhausted` with the non-null partial (`RunOutcome.value` now survives exhaustion). Every digest carries the `WakeBudgetBlock` (run and orchestrator spend, cap, reserve, the epsilon-floored orchestrator share, `softWarning` at 0.8) with `orchestrator:budget` telemetry at each wake boundary and at the cap; `CostReport.orchestrator` populates spentUsd, wakes, forcedFinish, and reserveUsedUsd for H-OrchShare.
- e70e7f4: M7-T13: the FINAL normative WakeDigest in ONE coordinated schema change (docs/07 section 5; XF-08/XF-12, inside the frozen hashVersion-2 identity rules). `WakeDigest` now declares every block first-class: `digestSeq`, `planHash` (emission-time plan hash, empty outside PlanRunner), `coversToOrdinal`, `completedDigests` ordered by spawn ordinal, `escalations` (with the Flavor B `deadlineAt`), the MANDATORY `termination` snapshot (DEF-2, contributed by the PlanRunner extension as a pure fold), the MANDATORY `budget` block (`WakeBudgetBlock`, DEF-7), and the `reuse` stats (the AbandonedSpendView shape, DEF-5). Runs without the PlanRunner extension ship all-zero blocks (`emptyDigestBlocks`), mirroring the CostReport convention. The digest render is bounded deterministically: the new `renderBudgetChars` option clamps each TaskDigest `outputSummary` by CHARACTERS (the model-independent interim measure; the tokenizer choice stays the docs/14 open question, the numeric default TBD before M10). Pinning semantics are unchanged: the digest is part of the wake snapshot and a re-executed turn reads identical bytes.
- bc9c903: M7-T14: the M7 gating cassettes and the remaining metric wiring (docs/09 sections "Metrics" and "Mandatory defect cassette catalog"). Thirteen frozen cassettes record the round-2 set (revise-mid-run, crash-during-revision, park-unpark, oscillation-freeze, half-escalated-ladder, budget-denied-rung), the DEF-7 set minus queue-failover (cap-freeze-then-finish, crash-between-cap-and-effects, finalize-fallback-synthesized, escalation-storm-frozen), and representative DEF-2/DEF-3 rows (revision-exhaustion, rung-retry-lineage, decompose-mints-children), each double-run at record time and replayed byte-for-byte in CI through the new public `@rulvar/plan` cassette runners with deterministic journal normalization (ULIDs, content hashes, wall clock, spans, and refs collapse to first-appearance placeholders). Metric events: `orchestrator:woke` now carries `planHash`, `coversToOrdinal`, and `renderSize` (the deterministic character measure of the delivered digest, the wake-render-size metric); the escalated landing emits `escalation:raised` with the report kind, the lineage attribution, `agentType` (the escalation-rate slice), and `costToDateUsd`; the abandoned/reclaimed/netLost USD view rides every digest through the T13 reuse block and `ledger:op` plus `spawn:*` events already feed ledger-ops-per-spawn.

### 0.7.0

#### Minor Changes

- fd1d06c: M6-T02: WorkerSandboxRunner and the sandbox contract. `@rulvar/planner` gains `WorkerSandboxRunner` (accepts CompiledWorkflow ONLY; worker_threads with the exact curated 12-global scope; timeoutMs 300000 / memoryMb 512 breaches terminate the worker with the new typed `SandboxError`, code `sandbox_limit`). Core gains the public host half, `createSandboxBridge`: proxied primitives (agent, step, workflow, awaitExternal, parallel, pipeline, phase, budget) served against the canonical run ctx with worker thunks executing under host-allocated scope tokens; the worker's SYNC seeded now/random/uuid (and the Date.now/Math.random replacements) mirror-journal as ordinary kind `rand` entries with match-first resume semantics; a busy-state protocol keeps suspension and quiescence behavior identical to in-process runs. `createEngine` gains `runners.sandbox`; `engine.run`/`engine.resume` accept CompiledWorkflow, persist the source blob plus workflowSourceRef/workflowHash at start, and `resume(runId)` with no workflow rehydrates the hash-pinned source (a differing supplied source is a typed ConfigError). New `FileTranscriptStore` makes compiled runs resumable across processes. The sandbox dialect exposes async `budget.spent()/remaining()`; import/fetch/process are absent from the worker scope.
- 6fcf296: M6-T04: profileCard and the API card. Core gains `profileCard(profiles)`: the one agent vocabulary both orchestration modes speak, feeding the planner prompt (mode b) and spawn_agent agentType guidance (mode c) with IDENTICAL text; pure function of the registry, sorted, byte-stable, rendering only model-agnostic fields (name, description, tool names, taskClass, estCost, escalation opt-in; models are never named). The planner gains `apiCard()`: the byte-stable card teaching exactly the curated 12-global sandbox dialect (schema literals only, tools by profile name, onError throw|null, async budget, no imports, the opts.key repeat rule) with usage patterns distilled from the examples corpus.
- dcc97a9: M6-T05: the plan agent and the self-repair loop (mode b). `plan(engine, goal, { model?, profiles?, repairRounds? })` asks a planner model under role `plan` to write a script against the API card plus the engine's profile card, lints it (eslint-plugin-rulvar preset + compileScript), self-repairs up to repairRounds (default 3) from the machine-readable JSON diagnostics, and returns `{ source, workflow, lint }`. The planner conversation is an ordinary journaled run with a goal-derived deterministic runId, so re-planning the same goal replays the unchanged prefix free; exhausting the rounds throws a typed ScriptRejected carrying the last diagnostics. `runPlanned(engine, goal, args?)` composes plan-then-sandbox-run (async by amendment). Core gains `AgentOpts.role` (`'loop' | 'plan' | 'orchestrate'`, the primary invocation role threading through resolution, effort defaults, floors, cost buckets, and events) and the narrow `Engine.profileCard(names?)` accessor rendering the registered profiles through the public API.
- 434dc83: M6-T06: AdmissionController v1 and nested workflows. `ctx.workflow(wf | 'name', args, { key? })` runs a child workflow under the single admission point: a `spawn-admission` decision entry embeds the closed `AdmitVerdict` union (admit | reuse_full | admit_graft | reject with the merged reject-code set; reuse branches produced from M7), the committed reserve, and statsBefore strictly before the two-phase `child` dispatch entry, so replay recovers verdicts and reserves without re-evaluating admission. Enforced: `maxDepth` (default 1, hard ceiling 4), `maxChildrenPerNode` (16), `childBudgetFraction` (0.3 of the parent remainder minus the parent finalize reserve), and the engine lifetime cap. The budget grows into a hierarchical account tree (run root plus one sub-account per child) with spend propagating to every ancestor, per-account layer-2 guards, and per-subtree layer-3 severing. Structural rejections throw the new typed `AdmissionRejectedError` (code `admission_rejected`); budget-class rejections keep `BudgetExhaustedError` semantics. The string form resolves against `defaults.workflows`; `budgetDefaults` gains `childBudgetFraction` and `maxDepth`, and `flatReserveUsd` is now honored. The abandon fold covers child-workflow scopes via the recorded dispatch payload.
- 03173c1: M6-T07 and M6-T08: the mode (c) dynamic orchestrator. `orchestrate(engine, goal, { model?, profiles?, maxSpawns?, budget?, limits? })` and `ctx.orchestrate(goal, opts)` share one implementation: an ordinary workflow whose agent (role `orchestrate`) holds the typed toolset with the normative docs/07 schemas: `spawn_agent`, `parallel_agents`, `await_any`, `await_all`, `cancel_agent`, and the loop-terminal `finish` (a new engine interception alongside escalate). Every spawn is an ordinary kind `agent` entry under the orchestrator's `agent:<seq>` scope, admitted through the single AdmissionController with the verdict, evaluated reserve, and statsBefore embedded in a `spawn-admission` decision entry (the budget debit itself rides the child's dispatch: one debit, never two); rejections surface as typed tool errors and never kill the run. Handles ARE the child dispatch seqs and stay stable across resume: a crashed orchestrator restores its transcript from the mandatory turn-boundary checkpoint, rebuilds its spawn records from the journal, redispatches only what was in flight, and finds settled children by content keys with zero re-paid spawns and no duplicate spawn decisions. `await_any`/`await_all` deliver deterministic TaskDigests; `cancel_agent` aborts an in-flight child to a `cancelled` terminal (caller intent; abandon coverage arrives with M7 cancel_task). The nested surface rides ctx.workflow, so maxDepth and the budget account tree clamp it for free; the orchestrator gets its own budget sub-account when a cap resolves (reserve decisions and the at-cap freeze are M7, DEF-7).
- 11c0afc: M6-T09 and M6-T10: wait_for_events, the WakeDigest substrate, and ctx.brief. `wait_for_events` (the normative docs/07 4.8 schema) parks the orchestrator on an ordinary DEF-4 suspension; the closed v1 trigger vocabulary is quiescence (always armed), child_terminal, escalation, and budget_threshold at the fixed 50/80 percents; a REQUESTED trigger set that can never fire (no run ceiling, unknown or fully delivered handles, no live children) is an immediate typed tool error, so an embedded run cannot hang unrecoverably. The wake is the closing resolution whose value IS the coalesced `WakeDigest` (substrate fields: digestSeq, coversToOrdinal, completedDigests ordered by spawn ordinal, escalations with reportRef): a re-executed post-crash turn reads exactly the same digest bytes, replay never rebuilds a digest, and simultaneous ready triggers journal one applied resolution plus noop losers under first-closing-wins. Trigger evaluation runs at arm time and on every child settlement; the orchestrator sleeps between wakes and its context grows O(wakes). `ctx.brief({ content, instruction?, model?, agentType? })` is a journaled summarize-role invocation (one agent-kind entry, free on replay) for handing an inheritable brief to a child.

### 0.6.0

#### Minor Changes

- fa05007: M5-T01 workflow registry and the @rulvar/cli base.

  - `@rulvar/core` gains the per-engine `WorkflowRegistry` type and
    `defaults.workflows` on createEngine (docs/06 section 10.4): an
    explicit first-class value, no module-level registry; shells resolve
    by-name runs against it (ctx.workflow's string form arrives M6, the
    queue worker M8).
  - Spec-conformance fix: the M4-T09 quality floors option moves from the
    createEngine top level to its canonical home `defaults.roleFloors`
    (docs/06 section 10.1). Update `createEngine({ floors })` call sites
    to `createEngine({ defaults: { roleFloors } })`.
  - `@rulvar/cli` ships its first real surface: the canonical grammar
    `rulvar run <file|name> [--args JSON] [--store PATH] [--budget-usd N]`,
    `rulvar resume <runId> [--args JSON] [--store PATH]`,
    `rulvar runs ls [--store PATH]`, `rulvar inspect &lt;runId&gt; [--store
PATH]` (no aliases), a line-oriented TUI progress renderer over the
    event stream, and interactive resolution of suspended approvals and
    externals (EOF leaves the run suspended, never errors). Engine
    assembly follows the host-config convention: `rulvar.config.mjs`
    default-exports `{ engineOptions?, workflows? }`, a workflow module
    may export `workflow`/`engineOptions`/`workflows`, and --store selects
    the JsonlFileStore directory (default `.rulvar`), so the CLI itself
    depends only on @rulvar/core. The `rulvar` bin is included; the
    resume/inspect grammar amendment (--args re-supply, --store symmetry)
    is recorded in docs/06 section 10.5.

- 9234dc8: M5-T03 cost reports. The CostReport builder moves to its own module
  (`engine/cost-report.ts`) and report totals become the LEDGER FOLD
  totals at settle: RunOutcome.usage and cost.totalUsd are computed from
  the journal's terminal entries (the same summation the kernel budget
  seed uses), so report totals equal ledger fold totals exactly, live and
  across resume, by construction. The new `costReportFromJournal(entries,
priceUsd)` is the pure fold for STORED runs: byModel and totals from
  terminal servedBy with abandoned subtrees contributing zero; phase,
  agentType, and role attribution are live-run facts that entries do not
  carry (byRole and the orchestrator block complete in M7 per DEF-7).
  Unpriced models keep surfacing, never as silent zeros. `rulvar inspect`
  gains the cost view (total, byModel, unpriced) over the config-assembled
  price function (table wins over caps.pricing), and live run output
  prints the byModel/byPhase buckets.
- 644512c: M5-T05 permission presets, audit, dry-run and M5-T06 argv shell matcher.

  - `compilePermissionPreset('strict' | 'standard' | 'open')`
    (`tools/presets.ts`) compiles the shipped presets to the documented
    verdict-by-risk tables and folds INTO the existing deny/ask chain
    layers, after host-authored rules, never a fifth layer and never an
    allow-override (a needsApproval tool still asks under every preset).
    `open` compiles to empty tables. `AgentProfilePermissions.preset` now
    compiles instead of throwing; undeclared tool risk is matched
    conservatively via a first-class `{ risk: 'undeclared' }` rule.
  - The argv shell matcher (`tools/shell-matcher.ts`) replaces the M5
    fail-early stub for `{ tool, argv }` rules: a POSIX-like lexer honors
    quotes and escapes with no expansion, splits on `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|`/`&`/
    newline, poisons segments containing command or process substitution
    or here-docs to ask, strips leading env assignments, and retains
    redirections as tokens. Verdicts compose strictest-across-segments, so
    `npm test; rm -rf /` yields deny (or ask) even with `npm test`
    allow-listed, and any unmatched segment yields ask.
  - `evaluatePermission` gains an offline overload (by tool name, no
    execution) for the docs/08 4.5 dry-run/shell-tooling API, and every
    verdict carries the audit payload (verdict, deciding layer, matched
    rule) that now rides `tool:end` events; advisory network-domain rules
    are reported there but never enforced outside first-party fetch
    (honest posture, docs/08 4.4).

- 8a41656: M5-T07 RunProfile presets and M5-T08 OTel exporter.

  - `engine/run-profiles.ts`: `RUN_PROFILES` (fast/standard/deep/ultra) and
    `runProfile(name)` ship the presets as pure DATA, bundles of per-role
    effort hints, per-run concurrency, budget, permission preset, and
    spawn limits, with no functions and no named model strings (named
    strong defaults stay in the umbrella). They are never engine
    semantics: a source-scan test asserts the engine has zero branches
    keyed on profile names. `rulvar run --profile <name>` applies the
    chosen profile UNDER the host's own engine options (host always wins;
    the engine then sees only ordinary options), compiling the profile's
    permission preset into the engine deny/ask layers as data.
  - `@rulvar/cli` gains `toOtel(run, tracer)`: it maps a settled run's
    spanId tree 1:1 onto OpenTelemetry spans (run > phase > agent > tool >
    child), with rulvar.* and gen_ai.* attributes, start/end timestamps
    from the lifecycle events, and payload-only events attached as span
    events. Prompts, completions, and tool payloads are NEVER exported;
    replayed events never create duplicate spans. `@opentelemetry/api`
    ^1.9 is an optional peer dependency and the exporter is typed against
    a minimal structural TracerLike, so an absent OTel package never
    breaks the CLI.

#### Patch Changes

- 02f7f7a: M5-T09 examples corpus. A new (unpublished) `examples/` vitest project
  ships runnable reference implementations of the documented quality
  patterns as recipes over the public `ctx` API, never engine flags:
  adversarial panel (N independent skeptics prompted to refute; majority
  survives), judge panel (N angled attempts each scored; top wins),
  loop-until-dry (keep finding until K consecutive empty rounds), and
  completeness critic (draft, then gap-driven revision passes). Each
  example is a real `defineWorkflow` and doubles as an integration test
  under FakeAdapter with zero live calls, so an example that stops
  compiling fails CI like any test. The corpus is registered in the
  pnpm workspace and the single Vitest project set; the umbrella marker
  package is unchanged (patch to carry the changeset).

### 0.5.0

#### Minor Changes

- ac274f4: M4-T01 role protocol completion. The full trigger protocol for the six
  invocation roles lands in `@rulvar/core` (`model/roles.ts`):

  - Extract necessity is completed per docs/04 section 8.3: a separate
    final structured-output invocation fires when a schema is set AND
    (routing directs extract to a different model OR the loop model's
    required tier cannot ride a tools-available turn OR finalize is
    routed). The required-tier rule is new: a `forced-tool` tier pins
    toolChoice to `emit_result` and cannot ride while the agent's tools
    must remain available, so such agents now pay one separate extract
    call instead of silently losing tool access. Agents without tools
    keep the M1 single-shot behavior byte for byte.
  - The finalize role fires for the first time: only when configured in
    routing and only for tool-bearing agents, as one synthesis invocation
    with toolChoice `'none'` over the full transcript after tools stop.
    Its text is the output for schema-less calls; with a schema the
    separate extract runs over the transcript including the synthesis.
  - A separate extract invocation over a tool-bearing transcript now
    carries the agent's tool contracts (both providers reject tool-use
    history without tool definitions) with toolChoice pinned to `'none'`
    or to `emit_result` per tier.
  - Both adapters map `toolChoice: 'none'` to the provider's explicit
    none choice with the tools param present instead of dropping tools
    from the request.
  - `createTestEngine` no longer routes `finalize` by default: the
    routing key is the firing opt-in, and the old default would have
    summoned a synthesis call for every tool-bearing test agent. Tests
    that want finalize route it explicitly.

  Identity is untouched: extract and finalize resolutions never enter
  the spawn content key, and existing journals replay unchanged.

- 5735d92: M4-T02 HistoryProjector. Cross-provider history projection lands in
  `@rulvar/core` (`model/projector.ts`) and the retention pipeline that
  feeds it:

  - `projectHistory` projects the canonical history into a target
    provider's view: provider-raw parts ride if and only if the target
    adapter's provider family matches the part's provider; everything
    else passes through untouched. The agent loop projects EVERY outgoing
    request (loop turns, finalize, extract), so per-role provider mixing
    inside one agent yields a valid wire history on each side.
  - Retention transport: adapters ship a turn's blocks-to-retain in
    stream order via `finish.providerMetadata[<adapter id>].retainedParts`;
    the runtime lifts them into provider-raw parts at the HEAD of the
    turn's canonical assistant message. `@rulvar/anthropic` ships thinking
    and redacted_thinking blocks (signatures intact, pause_turn
    continuations included); `@rulvar/openai` ships reasoning items with
    their encrypted_content. Retained blocks now actually reach the
    canonical history, survive checkpoints, and echo byte-exact to their
    own provider on every subsequent turn.
  - `ProviderAdapter` gains an optional `provider` field: the provider
    family for provider-raw matching (default = adapter id). The
    first-class adapters declare 'anthropic' and 'openai';
    `openaiCompatible` gateways declare 'openai' whatever their custom id,
    so same-family adapters share retained blocks and projections.

  Identity is untouched: projection state never enters content keys, and
  adapters that ship no retention payload (FakeAdapter included) produce
  byte-identical histories.

- 46ca98e: M4-T03 compaction ownership. The Agent Runtime owns compaction
  (`runtime/compaction.ts`):

  - Compaction is ON by default for every agent at threshold 0.8 of the
    loop model's contextWindow (docs/06 Appendix A);
    `AgentProfile.compaction.threshold` adjusts it per profile. The
    context estimate is the last loop turn's inputTokens + outputTokens.
  - At a tool turn boundary past the threshold the summarize role fires
    through the resolution chain (falling back to the loop model when
    routing resolves no summarize model; the low role-effort default
    applies either way), and the transcript after the first message is
    replaced by one user-role summary message. The summarize request is
    projected like any other and carries the tool contracts with
    toolChoice 'none'.
  - Compaction points (the turn numbers at which compaction fired) ride
    every checkpoint and restore verbatim: a resumed run continues from
    the compacted history and never re-summarizes it. Full-journal replay
    stays free as before.
  - A failed or empty summarize disables compaction for the rest of the
    run with a warning instead of failing paid work; budget and
    cancellation aborts propagate normally.

- 8ae129e: M4-T04 failover and M4-T05 RetryPolicy under the journal.

  - Transport RetryPolicy (`model/retry.ts`): the Appendix A defaults
    (attempts 3; backoff 500ms x2 max 8000ms with equal jitter; retryOn
    transport, rate-limit, overloaded) now actually retry around every
    adapter.stream dispatch: loop turns, extract, finalize, and summarize
    alike. Retries live UNDER the journal: a retried-then-successful call
    is one journal entry with one usage total, one turn, and no lineage
    attempts (DEF-3). A provider retryAfterMs replaces the computed
    delay; task-class failures never retry by construction; stream-idle
    severance retries as transport-class. Configure per call
    (`AgentOpts.retry`), per profile, or engine-wide
    (`defaults.retry`).
  - Transport failover (`model/failover.ts`): `ModelChoice.fallbacks`
    now works. When a serving model exhausts its tries on a transport or
    rate-limit failure, the sticky chain advances to the next resolved
    fallback (per-phase, effort defaults and caps scrubbing re-applied
    per serving model). The content key hashes the REQUESTED spec, so a
    failover-served response replays for free; only `servedBy` records
    the actual server (now surfaced on AgentResult and stamped on the
    terminal entry). Budget is explicitly excluded as a trigger.
  - The degenerate fallback field (`AgentOpts.fallback`, docs/04 11.3):
    an agent-level second attempt on a stronger model when the terminal
    matches `on` (error, limit, schema-exhausted), with exactly one
    journaled decision entry (`decisionType: 'model.fallback'`) reused on
    resume, and the fallback attempt under its own content key. Cancelled,
    escalated, and budget outcomes never trigger it.

  `AgentResult` gains the required `servedBy` field (additive for
  consumers reading results; literal constructions in tests need the new
  member).

- d1c4525: M4-T06 versioned price table and M4-T07 per-provider concurrency keys.

  - `model/pricing.ts`: `PriceTable { pricingVersion, models }` configured
    via `createEngine({ pricing })`. The table wins over adapter-reported
    `caps.pricing` (a fallback only); unpriced models keep surfacing in
    CostReport, never as a silent zero. Engine-written `model.fallback`
    decision entries pin the active `pricingVersion` so replayed cost
    attribution is stable against later table bumps; a price update is a
    registry update with a version bump, never a caps refresh side effect
    (`refreshCaps()` remains the adapter-level caps path).
  - `model/concurrency.ts`: `KeyedLimiter`, engine-scoped, configured via
    `createEngine({ concurrency: { perProvider } })` per adapter id. The
    Appendix A default stays unlimited: the per-run semaphore remains the
    only default bound and provider 429s ride RetryPolicy. When
    configured, every wire dispatch (retries and failover re-acquire)
    gates under its serving adapter's key, adapters throttle
    independently, and queueing surfaces as agent:queued telemetry with
    the provider key. There is deliberately no distributed cross-process
    limiter (docs/14).

- b840aba: M4-T08 canonical effort completion and M4-T09 role quality floors.

  - Effort semantics are complete: the role effort defaults and the
    per-adapter mapping tables (Anthropic passthrough including max,
    OpenAI max downmapped to xhigh and recorded in providerMetadata,
    provider none only via namespaced providerOptions) shipped earlier
    milestones; this change completes VISIBLE scrubbing everywhere it was
    still silent: the summarize invocation surfaces its scrubs at fire
    time and a failover takeover surfaces the fallback's scrubs the
    moment it starts serving. Scrubbed effort is never mapped into
    max_tokens.
  - The effort-defaults-shift cassette is now RECORDED through the live
    runtime (docs/10 M4 gating row): the frozen v1 prefix, closed offline
    the way an operator would, resumes live under explicit high effort
    with the completed semantics; every v1 entry matches and the one new
    spawn carries canonical effort in v2 identity. The recorder output is
    pinned byte-for-byte by the frozen-drift suite and the fixture lock
    now covers 18 files.
  - Quality floors (`model/floors.ts`, M4-T09): per-role and
    per-declared-taskClass allow/deny lists supplied via
    `createEngine({ floors })`, enforced INSIDE the router at resolution,
    before any live call and before any journal entry, for every
    invocation the chain produces (primaries, failover fallbacks, and the
    summarize fallback alike). `AgentProfile.taskClass` declares the
    class; unclassified profiles see only byRole floors. A violation is a
    typed ConfigError.
  - The umbrella `rulvar` package now ships floors opinions next to its
    strong routing defaults: `recommendedDefaults.floors` pins orchestrate
    and plan to strong named models. The core itself ships no named model
    strings, and the umbrella suite enforces that with a source scan.

### 0.4.0

#### Minor Changes

- dfe03b5: M3-T11 gating cassettes and the v0.4.0 BREAKING release notes.

  BREAKING (pre-1.0 convention, docs/12): `AgentStatus` now produces
  `'escalated'` at runtime and `AgentResult` carries the optional
  `escalation: EscalationReport` field (present if and only if the status
  is escalated). This is the third kernel amendment of the replay
  predicate (escalated-replays-as-ok, DEF-1) whose table row shipped
  frozen in M2; the producers ship here. Migration: add an `escalated`
  branch to every switch over `AgentStatus`; consumers not adopting the
  protocol are advised to map `escalated` to `limit` (paid partial work,
  output null, the report stays available for logs). `isEscalated` and
  `EscalatedResult` are exported for narrowing. Status production stays
  gated by opt-in: workflows that never pass `escalation` options cannot
  observe the new status at runtime.

  Cassettes: the DEF-1 live set (escalate-replay,
  crash-between-report-and-decision, flavor-b-timeout) is recorded through
  the live runtime and replayed strict; the M2 synthetic DEF-1 subset is
  re-recorded (memoize-classifier fully live; abandon-subtree through the
  kernel write APIs with a realistic escalated child report and an
  authorizing owner cancel decision; both re-record again with the
  orchestrator producers in M7). FakeAdapter gains fakeToolCalls and
  fakeWireError responder markers; replayRun gains the onEscalation
  pass-through so replay tests can prove the hook stays cold. The
  deliberate fixture regeneration updates fixtures.sha256 in the same
  change (the identity profile is UNCHANGED; this is the docs/10 M3-T11
  ordered re-record, not an identity-pipeline revision).

- d2089a7: M3-T02 turn-boundary checkpoints. The runtime writes a canonical-history
  checkpoint into TranscriptStore at every turn boundary where the loop
  continues (tool boundaries and schema re-prompts), at a deterministic ref
  derived from the dispatch seq; the terminal entry records checkpointRef.
  A dangling-dispatch resume (kill-and-resume) re-enters at the last
  boundary with zero re-paid turns, restored usage folds into the terminal
  exactly once, and an unreadable or unknown-format blob falls back to a
  full redispatch (tools stay at-least-once between execution and the
  checkpoint write). The blob format is engine-internal with a leading
  format byte; replayed agents recover their turn count from the checkpoint
  and re-emit tool:start/tool:end with the replay marker.
- 3f60234: M3-T07 terminal escalated status and EscalationProtocol producers (the
  BREAKING section for v0.4.0 rides the milestone release notes). Typed
  EscalationKind/EscalationReport/EscalationDecision/EscalationOptions;
  the escalate tool registers under escalation opt-in of either flavor
  through the same path as any tool (opting in changes toolsetHash by
  design) and is engine-intercepted after the permission chain. Status
  production is gated: without opt-in the escalate tool does not exist and
  'escalated' is physically unproducible. Flavor A terminates the worker
  with a runtime-completed report (costToDate and salvage are never
  model-authored; the request schema rejects them; the full report is
  validated BEFORE append; usage/costUsd/turns/transcriptRef as for ok,
  output null). Flavor B suspends on the approval machinery with a
  journaled deadlineAt (explicit deadlineMs required); a live decision and
  the deadline timer race through the ResolutionArbiter first-closing-wins
  (timeout applies defaultDecision, default accept); dispose collects the
  worktree patch into salvage BEFORE destruction; the terminal escalated
  entry and the authoritative escalation-decision entry follow strictly
  after, with countsAgainstLimit derived once (true iff scope_bigger).
  Replays synthesize the byte-identical report with zero adapter calls and
  read the owner's decision from the decision entry (a crash between
  report and decision pays the decision live exactly once). In ctx.parallel
  an escalated child is a settled outcome that never aborts siblings; a
  plain value-form call opting in requires the onEscalation hook
  (ConfigError before any LLM call otherwise). The in-run minSpend gate
  (M3-T09) rejects early scope_bigger escalations with a bounded "keep
  working" re-prompt; scope_different and blocked_with_evidence are
  exempt and never debit the counter.
- f668890: M3-T05 worktree isolation and M3-T06 openaiCompatible. GitWorktreeProvider
  implements the IsolationProvider seam: acquire creates a detached
  worktree from HEAD or a given ref (non-git host is a typed ConfigError),
  tools receive cwd inside the tree, collect() snapshots changed files and
  a binary patch, dispose removes the tree with keepOnError retention
  under the shared maxPinnedWorktrees cap (default 4). ctx.agent resolves
  isolation call-over-profile into spawn identity, stores the collected
  patch in TranscriptStore, and surfaces it as a kind 'patch' Artifact on
  AgentResult.artifacts and the terminal journal entry, so replays
  reconstruct artifacts with zero live calls; applying the patch stays
  with the caller. isolation 'readonly' is accepted as a declaration (its
  compiled deny rule ships with risk presets in M5).

  @rulvar/openai gains openaiCompatible({ id, baseURL, apiKey?, caps? })
  for Ollama, vLLM, and gateways: the Chat Completions dialect by
  construction, explicit ids so several endpoints coexist (duplicate id
  stays a ConfigError at createEngine), and the most conservative caps
  when unprobed (prompt-tier structured output, no parallel tools, no
  pricing; supplied caps merge over the floor).

- 16d7aa6: M3-T04 MCP ToolSource. `mcp(cfg)` imports Model Context Protocol tools
  over stdio, streamable-http, or an in-process server instance (pinned
  SDK line @modelcontextprotocol/sdk ^1.29; the v2 migration is the
  logged post-M3 task M5-T10). tools/list is fetched with cursor
  pagination until exhaustion and cached per session; a listChanged
  notification invalidates the cache for subsequently spawned agents only
  (a spawn's toolset snapshot stays immutable). allow/deny filters apply
  to pre-prefix names with deny winning; `prefix` namespaces collisions;
  `approval` maps to needsApproval per tool; host-supplied `risk` labels
  feed the permission presets. inputSchema becomes bare-JSON-Schema
  parameters (form 3); outputSchema validates structuredContent;
  isError maps to an error tool result surfaced to the model, never a
  protocol error; MCP tools hash version as absent, so provider-side
  contract drift re-keys new spawns by design.
- 6513ce8: M3-T08 no-progress abort class and M3-T10 UsageLimits completion. The
  engine-defined detector implements the committed docs/06 Appendix A
  interim rule (N consecutive turns without tool calls or artifact deltas,
  N = 3, configurable via the new UsageLimits.noProgressTurns knob): the
  abort journals as the agent's terminal entry with status 'limit', the
  dedicated 'no-progress' class marker in the error payload
  (AgentResult.abortClass), and memoizeOutcome stamped by the ENGINE on
  the terminal entry, so it replays on every resume without a live rerun
  regardless of the user's dispatch-time memoize policy (the predicate's
  entry-read consults the terminal stamp first; docs/03 section 6.6
  amendment). Tool-calling turns reset the streak: a working agent never
  trips. UsageLimits is complete: maxTurns, maxToolCalls,
  maxOutputTokensPerTurn, timeoutMs, streamIdleTimeoutMs, noProgressTurns,
  and the run-level deadline each independently produce their documented
  outcome, with per-limit tests including the memoized-limit
  replay/unmemoized rerun predicate integration. The M3-T09 minSpend gate
  gains the accumulation path test (scope_bigger passes once spend crosses
  minSpendUsd).
- 7dad493: M3-T03 permission chain and ask suspensions. The normative layered chain
  (hooks -> deny rules -> ask rules -> canUseTool -> terminal default) is
  the single approval surface for every tool dispatch; hooks run in
  deterministic registration order with modifiedInput substitution; rules
  never yield allow; an explicit canUseTool allow is decisive including
  over needsApproval; argv/domain rules and presets fail early until M5.
  Engine-wide defaults.permissions merges under profile permissions;
  inheritPermissions is carried as data for subagent spawning (mode c).
  An ask verdict journals a suspended approval entry (kind 'approval',
  identity {toolName, post-hook input}, agent child scope) together with
  the turn checkpoint; the run settles 'suspended' with the synthesized
  approval:&lt;seq&gt; key; RunHandle.resolveExternal validates
  { decision: 'allow' | 'deny' } and a denial surfaces to the model as an
  error tool result carrying the reason. An approval round-trip across
  process exit resumes the SAME turn: executed tool results are reused
  from the checkpoint, the resolved decision applies without
  re-suspension, and only post-approval turns are paid live.
- 2bbf180: M3-T01 tool system core plus the M3 entry-gate docs amendment. `tool()`
  definitions over the three SchemaSpec forms with definition-time
  validation (name pattern, schema projection, recursive/remote ref
  rejection); the ToolSource SPI seam types (ToolDef, ToolRisk, ToolContext,
  ToolSourceSession); per-spawn toolset resolution with duplicate-name and
  executor fail-early ConfigErrors; toolsetHash derived from contracts only
  (editing an execute body never re-keys a journal, bumping `version` does)
  and wired into spawn identity; agent-loop tool dispatch with argument
  validation, bounded ModelRetry conversion, NonSerializableValueError
  surfacing, maxToolCalls expiry as terminal `limit`, and tool:start /
  tool:end telemetry. The docs/06 Appendix A knob "no-progress detector N"
  is committed at 3 consecutive turns without tool calls or artifact deltas
  (consumed by M3-T08).

### 0.3.0

#### Minor Changes

- 43444f6: M2-T11/T12: the executable store conformance kit and the M2 gating
  cassettes with frozen fixtures.

  @rulvar/store-conformance ships its first real API: journalStoreConformance
  (A1 append atomicity, A2 total per-run order, A3 read-your-writes, A4
  opaque payload with read-side-only normalization, meta separation, the
  golden fold-state fixture with a frozen reference hash, the decide-once
  oracle, and the abandon-derived-skip fixture) and leasableStoreConformance
  (typed LeaseHeldError on held acquire, monotonic fencing epochs,
  stale-epoch appends rejected and invisible, released leases fenced from
  renew and append, optional ttl/renew-cadence timing checks), plus
  registerConformance for Vitest/Jest and the stableStringify fold-state
  hasher. InMemoryStore and JsonlFileStore pass; deliberately broken stores
  (reordering, normalizing, tearing, fencing-less) fail loudly.

  @rulvar/core kernel closes three DEF-1/DEF-4 gaps the cassettes gate: an
  abandon-covered hanging dispatch derives skipped instead of redispatching,
  abandon-covered operations contribute a zero ledger increment, the resume
  report lists covered entries as skipped (never orphaned), and an abandon
  over an already-resolved suspension folds to a noop with already_resolved
  (first-closing-wins per target, both closer kinds).

  @rulvar/testing ships the M2 cassette suite over committed frozen
  fixtures: the DEF-1 synthetic subset (abandon-subtree, memoize-classifier,
  v1-journal-on-v2), the DEF-4 set (timeout-vs-live-race,
  class-decision-fanout, abandon-then-crash-then-resume,
  abandon-vs-resolution-race, offline-invalid-then-valid,
  double-abandon-idempotent), the DEF-6 six IDs (resume-v1-on-engine-v2,
  resume-v1-with-inserted-call, suspended-v1-resolves-on-v2,
  reject-version-too-old via deriverV0Synthetic, reject-version-from-future,
  effort-defaults-shift), the mandatory mixed-version scenarios
  (ordinal-space split, forward-cursor preference, cross-version
  resolution, the compatibility and never-pay-twice-through-upgrade
  lemmas), and KeyDeriver contract tests against the frozen v2 golden
  identities including the docs/03 worked example. Fixture regeneration is
  deliberate: scripts/record-m2-cassettes.mjs rebuilds, and CI write
  protection (scripts/check-frozen-fixtures.mjs plus fixtures.sha256)
  fails any fixture diff shipped without the explicit bump token (the
  hyphenated compound of hashVersion and bump) in a changeset.

- 279881b: M2-T05/T06: the hashVersion mechanism and the canonical replay predicate.
  Frozen KeyDeriver profiles (v2 current; v1 with the effort-stripping
  projection, round-1 disposition table, and foldDefaults), the per-engine
  deriver registry with extraDerivers validation as the only window
  extender, the side-effect-free compatibility scan raising
  JournalCompatibilityError with sub-codes and hints, versioned matching
  through the registry KeyRing (live calls projected DOWN, incomparable is
  a guaranteed non-match, keys memoized per call and version); the single
  canonical replayDisposition with the three kernel amendments
  (memoizeOutcome on task-class failures via classifyAgentError,
  abandon-derived skipped through the append-order AbandonFold with
  transitive child-scope coverage, escalated-replays-as-ok), version
  dispatch by the entry's own profile, and the invalidate/retry unpinning
  API. @rulvar/compat ships the extraDerivers plumbing plus the synthetic
  hashVersion 0 deriver (manually versioned 0.1.0 per the lockstep
  exemption).
- 9fd0966: M2-T03/T04: scoped forward-matching and the kinds/grammar freeze. The
  JournalMatcher (per-scope insertion-stable cursors, first unconsumed
  match wins, cache/never per-call modes, orphan reporting) integrated into
  the Replayer with seeded seq/ordinal spaces and the resume ledger fold;
  ctx.agent/step/now/random/uuid replay journaled results byte-identically
  with zero adapter calls, dangling running entries redispatch with the
  terminal referencing the original dispatch, and replayed lifecycle events
  carry replayed: true. Kinds registry v2 payload validators enforce the
  docs/03 shapes on engine-written entries; the scope grammar gains a
  parser with round-trip guarantees. The interim disposition is round-1;
  the full DEF-1 table plugs in with M2-T06.
- 24ebadf: M2-T07/T08: suspension machinery (DEF-4). Strict ResolutionPayload and
  AbandonPayload with the normative by-source mapping; the
  first-closing-wins ResolutionFold (schema validation at consumption
  against the schema pinned inside the suspended entry, invalid offline
  resolutions never close, abandon coverage with transitive child
  scope-prefix and the AbandonFold projection consumed by the replay
  predicate); the per-target FIFO ResolutionArbiter (classify, durable
  append, settle exactly once; losing attempts are journaled noops); rule
  O2 hard errors on forward or dangling refs; Replayer
  resolveSuspended/abandonBranch/suspensionState; ctx.awaitExternal (NO
  deadline in v1, duplicate key in scope is a typed error) with run
  outcome 'suspended' plus pending[] on quiescence; and
  RunHandle.resolveExternal returning ResolutionOutcome, validating live
  payloads BEFORE append and journaling nothing on InvalidResolutionError.
- a1b35d3: M2-T09/T10: engine.resume under the run-to-definition binding contract
  (wf required for in-process runs, name mismatch is a typed ConfigError,
  body-hash mismatch warns loudly and proceeds; the compatibility scan
  runs strictly before any side effect; the resumed run seeds the budget
  from the ledger fold, re-emits open suspensions, and reports
  ResumePreview hits/misses/reruns/orphans plus invalid offline
  resolutions), the dryRun option (replay-strict matching: the first
  would-be-live call settles the run with the typed journal_miss error and
  zero live calls), and @rulvar/testing replayRun (tier 3: strict replay
  of any journal with JournalMissError on ANY live call; suspended
  journals finish suspended with zero live calls).
- 18a5821: M2-T01/T02 groundwork: JsonlFileStore (one JSON entry per line, the
  journal doubles as an event log; torn-trailing-line tolerance and repair
  for A1 atomicity; atomic temp-plus-rename meta replace; listRuns without
  payload parsing; mid-file corruption is a hard JournalOrderViolation) and
  the committed large-value soft warn threshold (262144 bytes, docs/06
  Appendix A M2 entry gate) wired into the journal append path as a
  warning event, never an error.

### 0.2.0

#### Minor Changes

- c24228d: M1-T10/T11: the WorkflowEvent envelope and M1 catalog (per-run telemetry
  seq distinct from JournalEntry.seq, span hierarchy run > phase > agent),
  the per-run EventBus feeding RunHandle.events and on(), RunOutcome with
  exhausted-overrides-error precedence and the normative CostReport
  (byModel/byPhase/byAgentType/byRole, the all-zero orchestrator block,
  unpriced evidence); createEngine with per-engine registries and
  engine.run over the ScriptRunner seam; InProcessRunner with the dev-mode
  bare-Date.now/Math.random warnings; run cancellation (host signal,
  handle.cancel, run deadline) and RunMeta run-to-definition binding
  fields. The umbrella ships the minimal terminal progress renderer
  (renderProgress) and re-exports the core surface.
- c50871e: M1-T04/T05: journal write path and model router core. JournalEntry form
  with the kinds registry v2 and hashVersion (written as 2 from day one),
  IdentityInput records per spawn kind with content-key derivation (sha256
  over RFC 8785 JCS; reproduces the docs/03 worked example byte-identically),
  the scope-path grammar, ordinal assignment, the per-run serialized append
  queue with the JSON-serializability check, the budget-ledger fold,
  JournalStore/LeasableStore/TranscriptStore SPI types, InMemoryStore (loud
  one-time resume-disabled warning) and InMemoryTranscriptStore; the
  per-engine adapter registry (duplicate adapterId is a ConfigError), strict
  ModelRef parsing, the per-invocation resolution chain with role effort
  defaults, CanonicalModelSpec canonicalization, visible caps scrubbing
  (effort and sampling parameters), and structured-output tier selection
  with the strict-compatibility predicate.
- 1af8fb9: M1-T01/T02/T03: L0 foundations. Wire contracts (Msg/Part with provider-raw,
  ChatRequest, the ChatEvent union with typed refusal finish outcomes, the
  Usage invariant, CanonicalId minting, cacheHint, canonical five-level
  Effort, the ModelSpec family declarations); the closed error taxonomy
  (RulvarError base, WireError projection, all named error classes, the
  AgentError value projection); SchemaSpec in its three forms with Out&lt;S&gt;
  inference, StandardJSONSchemaV1 projection (draft 2020-12 with draft-07
  fallback), canonical schema derivation (JCS, local $ref inlining,
  annotation stripping), schemaHash/toolsetHash, and runtime validation via
  the vendored draft 2020-12 validator.
- 1fe0249: M1-T06/T07/T08/T09: agent runtime v1 (single subagent loop, structured
  output in three tiers with client validation and the bounded re-prompt,
  typed AgentResult with the ok/error/limit/cancelled/skipped vocabulary,
  ModelRetry declaration, UsageLimits with the normative merge and defaults,
  typed refusal handling, Usage-invariant verification at the adapter
  boundary); ctx primitives (defineWorkflow with the errorPolicy literal
  generic, ctx.agent overloads including result: 'full', ctx.parallel with
  Settled and abortSiblings semantics, ctx.pipeline with up to six stages
  and onItemError drop/throw/collect, ctx.step with useMemo-style deps
  keying, ctx.phase cost attribution, ctx.log, ctx.budget, and the
  deterministic now/random/uuid shims journaled as rand entries); the
  per-run FIFO semaphore scheduler; and the three-layer budget (admission
  reserves, the per-turn guard, the AbortSignal ceiling with usageApprox,
  immutable B0, BudgetExhaustedError thrown uniformly by every ctx
  primitive, run.dropped evidence for every silent loss).
- 5c4fc32: M1-T14/T15: @rulvar/testing tier 1 (FakeAdapter matching on
  agentType/label/prompt regex with a '*' fallback, honoring the selected
  structured-output tier, zero USD by construction; createTestEngine over
  the full real engine with recorded event streams; toHaveCalledAgent and
  toStayUnderBudget matchers at '@rulvar/testing/matchers') and the
  completed umbrella (re-exports of @rulvar/core and both first-class
  adapters, renderProgress, the umbrella-only recommendedDefaults strong
  model slots, the M1 exit-criteria example workflow, and the CI install
  smoke on packed tarballs). The core now populates the reserved
  providerOptions 'rulvar' telemetry namespace on every request (docs/04
  section 1.8 as amended) and AgentResult carries errorMessage detail for
  journaled WireError fidelity.

### 0.1.0

#### Minor Changes

- f4e2be9: M0 repo bootstrap (v0.1.0, docs/10-implementation-plan.md section "M0"):
  monorepo scaffold on the committed toolchain (pnpm 11 workspaces with
  catalogs, TypeScript 6.0, tsdown, Vitest 4, ESLint 9 flat config,
  Turborepo 2, changesets fixed mode, npm trusted publishing), the docs/
  canon as single source of truth, the L0 contracts skeleton in @rulvar/core,
  and the vendored dependencies (StandardSchemaV1/StandardJSONSchemaV1 types,
  the @cfworker/json-schema lineage validator subset, a first-party monotonic
  ULID). Placeholder scaffolds only: no public API ships in this release.

## eslint-plugin-rulvar

### 1.4.0

### 1.3.2

#### Patch Changes

- ddef383: Every published package now ships a README, so its npm page states what the package is, how it installs, and where the documentation lives (npm includes README.md in the tarball regardless of the files allowlist, so no manifest changes are involved; @rulvar/compat gains its README on its own next release). Alongside, the repository-level pages are refreshed to the current project state: the root README is rewritten around the never-pay-twice pitch with a runnable quickstart condensation and the full package table, CONTRIBUTING.md lists the complete PR gate set, the examples README drops retired-spec citations for live docs.rulvar.com links and documents the dogfood journal replay, and the pointer README gets the same treatment.

### 1.3.1

#### Patch Changes

- 7d1552e: Runtime message strings no longer cite the retired internal specification set: error and warning messages, validation issues, and the CLI help text drop the dangling `docs/NN, section ...` references, pointing at https://docs.rulvar.com pages where a pointer earns its place (the CLI help header, tool naming, toolset registries, bare resume). The umbrella package description sheds the naming-contingency note: the unscoped alias is published and owned. Three strings embedded in frozen recordings stay byte-identical on purpose (the no-progress abort reason and two testing-internal recorder strings), as does the byte-locked golden-fold fixture. Test-file comments lose their citations too; test titles are unchanged.

### 1.3.0

### 1.2.0

#### Patch Changes

- 154507b: TSDoc and inline comments no longer cite the retired internal specification set (the pre-docs-site `docs/NN, section ...` references). The citations either became links to the public documentation at docs.rulvar.com or were dropped where the comment already carried the rule; traceability markers (DEF-n, XF-nn, FR-nnn, OQ-nn, W-nnn) are untouched. Comment-only change: no runtime behavior, no API shapes, and no runtime message strings were modified; the frozen golden-fold fixture is byte-identical.

### 1.1.0

### 1.0.0

### 0.9.0

### 0.8.0

### 0.7.0

#### Minor Changes

- 4aaf2d5: M6-T03: the determinism rule set with structural JSON diagnostics (docs/06 8.4). Rules: no-bare-date (Date.now and new Date), no-bare-random (Math.random), no-fetch (bare and globalThis.fetch), no-process-env, no-promise-all-over-ctx (Promise.all/allSettled/race/any spawning ctx or bare sandbox calls; ctx.parallel instead), and the duplicate-identical-call advisory (byte-identical ctx.agent/ctx.workflow calls in one function forward-match to one journal entry; opts.key distinguishes deliberate repeats). Locally shadowed globals are never flagged. The flat preset `configs.workflows` wires every rule at its intended severity, and `toJsonDiagnostics` projects lint messages into the machine-readable shape the mode (b) self-repair loop consumes.

### 0.6.0

### 0.5.0

### 0.4.0

### 0.3.0

### 0.2.0

### 0.1.0

#### Minor Changes

- f4e2be9: M0 repo bootstrap (v0.1.0, docs/10-implementation-plan.md section "M0"):
  monorepo scaffold on the committed toolchain (pnpm 11 workspaces with

### 1.4.0

#### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c4f563d]
  - @rulvar/core@1.4.0
  - @rulvar/testing@1.4.0

### 1.3.2

#### Patch Changes

- ddef383: Every published package now ships a README, so its npm page states what the package is, how it installs, and where the documentation lives (npm includes README.md in the tarball regardless of the files allowlist, so no manifest changes are involved; @rulvar/compat gains its README on its own next release). Alongside, the repository-level pages are refreshed to the current project state: the root README is rewritten around the never-pay-twice pitch with a runnable quickstart condensation and the full package table, CONTRIBUTING.md lists the complete PR gate set, the examples README drops retired-spec citations for live docs.rulvar.com links and documents the dogfood journal replay, and the pointer README gets the same treatment.

### 1.3.1

#### Patch Changes

- 7d1552e: Runtime message strings no longer cite the retired internal specification set: error and warning messages, validation issues, and the CLI help text drop the dangling `docs/NN, section ...` references, pointing at https://docs.rulvar.com pages where a pointer earns its place (the CLI help header, tool naming, toolset registries, bare resume). The umbrella package description sheds the naming-contingency note: the unscoped alias is published and owned. Three strings embedded in frozen recordings stay byte-identical on purpose (the no-progress abort reason and two testing-internal recorder strings), as does the byte-locked golden-fold fixture. Test-file comments lose their citations too; test titles are unchanged.

### 1.2.0

#### Patch Changes

- 5ac56b4: Criterion 2 of the measured-value checkpoint gains the quality branch per the founder's OQ-09 amendment (2026-07-12): the card-informed arm passes by matching the baseline pass rate at no more than 105 percent of its cost, OR by beating it by at least 15 points at no more than 115 percent. The reopened gate measured plus 40 and plus 20 points at 107.9 and 106.6 percent: the baseline fails cheaply, so the flat cost bar tightened exactly when the card won on quality. The vacuous-pass guard stands unchanged; the rule now lives in the exported agentTypeRuleHolds next to rungRuleHolds.
- 154507b: TSDoc and inline comments no longer cite the retired internal specification set (the pre-docs-site `docs/NN, section ...` references). The citations either became links to the public documentation at docs.rulvar.com or were dropped where the comment already carried the rule; traceability markers (DEF-n, XF-nn, FR-nnn, OQ-nn, W-nnn) are untouched. Comment-only change: no runtime behavior, no API shapes, and no runtime message strings were modified; the frozen golden-fold fixture is byte-identical.

### 1.1.0

#### Minor Changes

- 00f1ab5: M12-T01: the measured-value checkpoint harness (docs/05, section "Phases and placement"; the OQ-09 criteria). `runValueCheckpoint` executes the M12 gate as two A/B experiments under one fixed pool: criterion 1 (rung selection) runs every eval case per (ladder, taskClass) cell at the ladder's default start tier versus the tier recommended by `compileVerifiedLayer` over the store's claims, judging each recommended cell by the OQ-09 rule (equal-or-better pass rate at 90 percent of the cost, or five points better at cost) with unrecommended cells neutral for the majority but included in the pooled aggregate; criterion 2 (agentType selection) runs the same orchestrate-role cases with and without the knowledge store and requires the card-informed arm to match or beat the baseline pass rate within 105 percent of its cost. The checkpoint passes only when both hold; `renderCheckpointReport` produces the docs-ready record, and an unmeasured criterion 2 honestly counts as failed. The fixed mixed corpus (extraction, code-edit, judging; a seeded LCG keeps it byte-stable; the seed/eval split prevents leakage into the treatment arm) and the budget-guarded live Anthropic runner ship as repo scripts.

#### Patch Changes

- 63b2c01: Two defects the first live M12 checkpoint run surfaced. The Anthropic capability table lacked a Haiku 4.5 entry, so the dated id fell through to the current-generation default and the adapter sent adaptive thinking, which that model rejects with a live 400 (every haiku run died at zero cost): `claude-haiku-4-5` (and its dated snapshots by the prefix rule) now resolves to the enabled-budget thinking form with real haiku pricing, meaning the default wire omits thinking entirely. And the checkpoint's criterion 2 could pass vacuously when both arms scored zero at zero cost (zero satisfies "at least equal at no more cost"): the card-informed arm must now win something real (nonzero n and pass rate) before the criterion can hold.
- 42050b5: The checkpoint's orchestrated arms take their own suite options (`orchestratedSuite`, defaulting to `suite`): the third live run showed the shared per-case budget starving the orchestrator cap math (a $0.10 run ceiling cannot host the default finalize reserve, so every orchestrate-role run died at OrchestratorCapConfigError before the first model call, at zero cost).
- Updated dependencies [d16b04a]
  - @rulvar/core@1.1.0
  - @rulvar/testing@1.1.0

### 1.0.0

#### Minor Changes

- 6649e5f: M11-T01: the eval-committer identity activates eval-measured claims (docs/05, sections "Data model" and "Commit discipline", amended with the dedicated `eval-committer` GateRecord variant, distinct from the v2-reserved eval-confirmed proposal auto-gate).

  - Commit validation is now GATE-DRIVEN and the coherence square is schema-enforced in both directions: an eval-committer-gated op MUST carry class eval-measured, author kind eval-pipeline, and the metrics block; a human-gated op MUST NOT carry any of the three (a human-authored op with metrics keeps rejecting). Observational data never carries metrics and never auto-promotes.
  - `@rulvar/evals` ships the pipeline side: `evalMeasuredClaim` (the docs/05 TTL table applied by polarity: strength 90 days, weakness 30) and `commitEvalMeasured` with the documented CAS-rebase recipe against any ModelKnowledgeStore.

- eaacdeb: M11-T02: matrix sweeps (docs/05, section "Grounding and decay"). `runSweepMatrix` measures a FIXED pool (workflow x model x taskClass; sweep volume is never authorized by proposal volume) through the ordinary engine, sequentially in declaration order for deterministic cassette consumption, and aggregates per (model, taskClass) cell.

  - Threshold-crossing cells emit eval-measured claims (strength at or above 0.9, weakness at or below 0.5 by default; the mid band emits nothing): typed statement templates, metrics {passRate, n, graderId}, EvidenceRef eval reports with the case ids, confidence from n, the docs/05 TTL table from observedAt, and deterministic report-scoped claim ids.
  - With a store given, claims commit through the eval-committer identity (the M11-T01 gate); the sweep e2e records against fake adapters and replays hermetically from the cassette with zero live calls, byte-identical reports.

- 01d6b2d: M11-T04: modelEpoch capture and the canary fingerprint (docs/05, section "Grounding and decay"; OQ-06 CLOSED with the committed design).

  - Core: `modelEpochOf`/`capsHashOf` build the honestly coarse epoch signal (registry version, pricing version, caps hash; silent alias re-pointing stays a documented uncaught case absent probes). The ClaimOp union gains `mark_stale` (docs/05 amended): section 6 requires status stale at fingerprint drift and the closed op set could not produce it; active flips to stale, already-stale is an idempotent noop, terminals never revive.
  - Evals: `canaryFingerprint(engine, probes)` runs the FIXED caller-versioned probe set sequentially through the ordinary engine and hashes NFC-normalized, whitespace-collapsed outputs (the probe count prefixes the hash so probe-set edits never collide with drift). `flipStaleOnCanaryDrift` flips the model's active eval-measured claims whose recorded fingerprint differs, in one CAS-rebased command; claims without a baseline stay untouched. Sweeps stamp the epoch per pool member via `modelEpochFor`.

- e679c6e: M9-T02: the @rulvar/evals base (docs/09 section 7; docs/11 "Eval CI"; FR-5xx). First real public surface of @rulvar/evals, built strictly on the public APIs (L6).

  - `EvalCase = { workflow, args, graders[] }` exactly as documented, with `runEvalCase` and `runEvalSuite` runners: the target workflow runs as its own journaled run; latency is derived from run:start and run:end event timestamps (no separate measurement channel); duplicate workflow names disambiguate by ordinal.
  - Three grader families: `goldenGrader` (deep JSON equality with diff evidence), `rubricGrader` (named pure criteria, per-criterion verdicts, fraction score against a pass threshold), and `judgeGrader` (an LLM verdict against a schema). The judge runs THROUGH the engine via `GraderContext.judge` as an ordinary journaled, budgeted invocation, so judge calls are VCR-recordable and eval CI replays them deterministically with zero live calls. @rulvar/evals ships NO default judge model: weak judge defaults are forbidden by the router quality floors, so `model` is required. Judge invocations are skipped deterministically when the target run did not settle ok.
  - `runEvalMatrix` compares configuration cells (profile vs profile, cheap workers vs premium, reviewer on or off): each cell supplies its own engine and the report carries pass-rate, cost, and latency per cell from the existing usage and cost fields. No failure clustering, no vector dependency (EXC registry).
  - Acceptance held in-suite: a suite recorded through the VCR adapters replays byte-deterministically (latency excluded as the one wall-clock measurement) from the cassette under onMiss 'throw', and the cassette carries its hashVersion header (DEF-6).

### 0.5.0

#### Minor Changes

- ac274f4: M4-T01 role protocol completion. The full trigger protocol for the six
  invocation roles lands in `@rulvar/core` (`model/roles.ts`):

  - Extract necessity is completed per docs/04 section 8.3: a separate
    final structured-output invocation fires when a schema is set AND
    (routing directs extract to a different model OR the loop model's
    required tier cannot ride a tools-available turn OR finalize is
    routed). The required-tier rule is new: a `forced-tool` tier pins
    toolChoice to `emit_result` and cannot ride while the agent's tools
    must remain available, so such agents now pay one separate extract
    call instead of silently losing tool access. Agents without tools
    keep the M1 single-shot behavior byte for byte.
  - The finalize role fires for the first time: only when configured in
    routing and only for tool-bearing agents, as one synthesis invocation
    with toolChoice `'none'` over the full transcript after tools stop.
    Its text is the output for schema-less calls; with a schema the
    separate extract runs over the transcript including the synthesis.
  - A separate extract invocation over a tool-bearing transcript now
    carries the agent's tool contracts (both providers reject tool-use
    history without tool definitions) with toolChoice pinned to `'none'`
    or to `emit_result` per tier.
  - Both adapters map `toolChoice: 'none'` to the provider's explicit
    none choice with the tools param present instead of dropping tools
    from the request.
  - `createTestEngine` no longer routes `finalize` by default: the
    routing key is the firing opt-in, and the old default would have
    summoned a synthesis call for every tool-bearing test agent. Tests
    that want finalize route it explicitly.

  Identity is untouched: extract and finalize resolutions never enter
  the spawn content key, and existing journals replay unchanged.

- 5735d92: M4-T02 HistoryProjector. Cross-provider history projection lands in
  `@rulvar/core` (`model/projector.ts`) and the retention pipeline that
  feeds it:

  - `projectHistory` projects the canonical history into a target
    provider's view: provider-raw parts ride if and only if the target
    adapter's provider family matches the part's provider; everything
    else passes through untouched. The agent loop projects EVERY outgoing
    request (loop turns, finalize, extract), so per-role provider mixing
    inside one agent yields a valid wire history on each side.
  - Retention transport: adapters ship a turn's blocks-to-retain in
    stream order via `finish.providerMetadata[<adapter id>].retainedParts`;
    the runtime lifts them into provider-raw parts at the HEAD of the
    turn's canonical assistant message. `@rulvar/anthropic` ships thinking
    and redacted_thinking blocks (signatures intact, pause_turn
    continuations included); `@rulvar/openai` ships reasoning items with
    their encrypted_content. Retained blocks now actually reach the
    canonical history, survive checkpoints, and echo byte-exact to their
    own provider on every subsequent turn.
  - `ProviderAdapter` gains an optional `provider` field: the provider
    family for provider-raw matching (default = adapter id). The
    first-class adapters declare 'anthropic' and 'openai';
    `openaiCompatible` gateways declare 'openai' whatever their custom id,
    so same-family adapters share retained blocks and projections.

  Identity is untouched: projection state never enters content keys, and
  adapters that ship no retention payload (FakeAdapter included) produce
  byte-identical histories.

### 0.4.0

#### Minor Changes

- f668890: M3-T05 worktree isolation and M3-T06 openaiCompatible. GitWorktreeProvider
  implements the IsolationProvider seam: acquire creates a detached
  worktree from HEAD or a given ref (non-git host is a typed ConfigError),
  tools receive cwd inside the tree, collect() snapshots changed files and
  a binary patch, dispose removes the tree with keepOnError retention
  under the shared maxPinnedWorktrees cap (default 4). ctx.agent resolves
  isolation call-over-profile into spawn identity, stores the collected
  patch in TranscriptStore, and surfaces it as a kind 'patch' Artifact on
  AgentResult.artifacts and the terminal journal entry, so replays
  reconstruct artifacts with zero live calls; applying the patch stays
  with the caller. isolation 'readonly' is accepted as a declaration (its
  compiled deny rule ships with risk presets in M5).

  @rulvar/openai gains openaiCompatible({ id, baseURL, apiKey?, caps? })
  for Ollama, vLLM, and gateways: the Chat Completions dialect by
  construction, explicit ids so several endpoints coexist (duplicate id
  stays a ConfigError at createEngine), and the most conservative caps
  when unprobed (prompt-tier structured output, no parallel tools, no
  pricing; supplied caps merge over the floor).

  passthrough including max, native json_schema format), strict tools,
  cache_control compilation from cacheHint (deepest-4 kept), thinking-block
  retention with provider-granularity projection, pause_turn absorption
  without synthetic user messages, the full stop-reason table with typed
  refusal stop details, count_tokens, capabilities-bearing refreshCaps,
  retry-after/x-ratelimit/529 signaling, SDK autoretries disabled, usage
  normalization under the Usage invariant. @rulvar/openai: Responses API
  with manual item replay only (store false, encrypted reasoning echoed
  verbatim; previous_response_id/Conversations rejected as ConfigError),
  flattened strict function tools, text.format json_schema, the typed SSE
  catalog mapped to ChatEvent, the Chat Completions degraded path (visible
  via providerMetadata), effort mapping with the documented lossy
  max-to-xhigh downmap and provider none via providerOptions only, usage
  normalization.

- ddef383: Every published package now ships a README, so its npm page states what the package is, how it installs, and where the documentation lives (npm includes README.md in the tarball regardless of the files allowlist, so no manifest changes are involved; @rulvar/compat gains its README on its own next release). Alongside, the repository-level pages are refreshed to the current project state: the root README is rewritten around the never-pay-twice pitch with a runnable quickstart condensation and the full package table, CONTRIBUTING.md lists the complete PR gate set, the examples README drops retired-spec citations for live docs.rulvar.com links and documents the dogfood journal replay, and the pointer README gets the same treatment.

### 1.3.1

#### Patch Changes

- 7d1552e: Runtime message strings no longer cite the retired internal specification set: error and warning messages, validation issues, and the CLI help text drop the dangling `docs/NN, section ...` references, pointing at https://docs.rulvar.com pages where a pointer earns its place (the CLI help header, tool naming, toolset registries, bare resume). The umbrella package description sheds the naming-contingency note: the unscoped alias is published and owned. Three strings embedded in frozen recordings stay byte-identical on purpose (the no-progress abort reason and two testing-internal recorder strings), as does the byte-locked golden-fold fixture. Test-file comments lose their citations too; test titles are unchanged.

### 1.3.0

#### Minor Changes

- 7d1a287: ModelKnowledge phase 3, first slice (M12-T02, unlocked by the passed measured-value checkpoint): the kb_propose orchestrator tool and the quarantined modelObservations write path. PlanRunner registers kb_propose on explicit opt-in (PlanRunnerOptions.kbPropose, like any opt-in tool); its payload is tier-relative (the orchestrator never names a model) and the engine resolves the tier against the referenced lineage's declared ladder into the concrete KbProposal subject, validates that the tier has a journaled attempt and that evidence refs resolve to this run's decision entries, and journals the proposal as the observation_add ledger.op through the single-writer path. Quarantine is absolute: the ack is entryRef only, ledger_read withholds observation content behind a count (byte-stable for observation-free renders), worker prompts never see it, and nothing can commit during a run (the runtime handle has no write path by API shape); proposals reach the human gate only through the post-run LedgerExport. Core exports KbProposal, KbProposalTrigger and the typed model-free proposalStatement template. The kb-propose-quarantine cassette joins the frozen catalog (61 IDs).

### 1.2.0

#### Patch Changes

- 154507b: TSDoc and inline comments no longer cite the retired internal specification set (the pre-docs-site `docs/NN, section ...` references). The citations either became links to the public documentation at docs.rulvar.com or were dropped where the comment already carried the rule; traceability markers (DEF-n, XF-nn, FR-nnn, OQ-nn, W-nnn) are untouched. Comment-only change: no runtime behavior, no API shapes, and no runtime message strings were modified; the frozen golden-fold fixture is byte-identical.

#### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d16b04a]
  - @rulvar/core@1.1.0

### 1.0.0

#### Minor Changes

- 0e0b569: M10 entry: the render budgets of docs/06 Appendix A are committed (the TBD-before-M10 rule) and wired as engine defaults; OQ-04 (the renderBudget measure) closes on the CHARACTER measure.

  - WakeDigest: 400 chars per outputSummary row, one exported constant (`WAKE_SUMMARY_RENDER_BUDGET_CHARS`) now serving both the distillation cap (adopted unchanged, the value frozen into every cassette since M6) and the digest render default of `renderBudgetChars`, which stays overridable per orchestration.
  - ledger_read render: 65536 chars over the serialized view via the new pure `boundLedgerRender` (exported with `LEDGER_RENDER_BUDGET_CHARS`): over budget, rows drop deterministically oldest-first (auto-derived joins before authored sections, the mission brief slices last) and every drop renders as a FLAGGED discrepancy line. The section caps stay the primary bound, so under default termination limits the belt never engages; all frozen fixtures are byte-identical.
  - KB card: 4096 chars, committed in docs and consumed by the M10-T03 card renderer.

- 4454175: M10-T03: the ModelKnowledge read path (docs/05, sections "Read path" and "Security"). kb_pinned and kb_repinned land, the card renders, and the whole feature is store-gated: an engine without `stores.modelKnowledge` writes no kb entries at all, so every existing journal and cassette stays byte-stable (zero added awaits on the off path).

  - `createEngine` accepts `stores.modelKnowledge`; the runtime holds ONLY the `current()` handle (commit is physically absent inside runs).
  - One read at run admission for orchestrate-role runs: the engine filters claims (active, unexpired, reachable through the run's declared ladders after the role-floor filter) and journals `kb_pinned { version, hash, cardText }` with the card bytes EMBEDDED, strictly before the first orchestrator turn. Resume and replay read the entry bytes and never touch the live store.
  - A fresh `kb_repinned` lands on every wait_for_events wake under the same filtering rules against a FRESH store read, so expired, stale, and archived claims never steer spawns after pauses; a mid-run store commit affects only subsequent pins.
  - `modelKnowledgeCard`: deterministic, two-layer, tier-relative, 4096-char budget (oldest notes withhold behind an explicit marker). The verified layer compiles EXCLUSIVELY from eval-measured claims (empty in phase 1) with the one-rung clamp; editorial notes render dated and explicitly marked, never compiled into a tier; the orchestrator never sees model names. The card docks into the spawn tool description beside the profile card.
  - OQ-11 closes: editorial notes render for every taskClass with no self-description suppression (the nameless tier-relative render already blunts the feared bias).
  - Two catalog cassettes (docs/09, new section 6.11): kb-pin-replay and kb-repin-expiry, recorded offline over a deterministic stub store with time-stable dates; the cassette-catalog CI job runs them.

- 6599ca8: M10-T05: the taskClass binding interim rule becomes the phase-1 resolution (docs/05, section "Phases and placement"; docs/14 OQ-12 CLOSED). The classification source is author declaration: the optional `taskClass` on AgentProfile, TaskSpec, and spawn_agent params; absence means unclassified and stores no literal string anywhere. Card recommendations never apply to unclassified spawns (in phase 1 no recommendation application exists at all; the M11 compiler inherits the rule as normative).

  - The plan dispatch now forwards the declared TaskSpec.taskClass onto the ExtensionDispatchSpec, completing the substrate: a declared class journals inside the spawn-admission decision (spawn_agent path) and the plan.revision spec of record (PlanRunner path), so M11 matrix sweeps and the recommendation compiler slice attempts by class from journals alone.
  - Byte-neutral: journals without declared classes are unchanged; floors stay profile-driven per docs/04.

- 0fbe7ea: M9-T04 (part 1): the DEF-2 and DEF-3 catalog rows deferred at M7 (docs/09 sections 6.2 and 6.3; docs/10 M9 row "Complete catalog green in one CI run"), plus the producers and liveness fixes the rows exposed.

  - Nine new frozen cassettes with public runners and byte-for-byte replay tests: combined-loop-descent, config-drift-resume, class-storm-single-turn, oscillation-bounded, race-timeout-vs-live (DEF-2); respawn-preserves-counter, reworded-lessons-collide, stall-streak-classes-and-pinning, legacy-journal-resume (DEF-3). The class and race rows additionally round-trip their frozen bytes through BOTH reference stores (JsonlFileStore and SqliteStore) with identical loads, per the store-independence rule.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: the class-level escalation decision producer lands (docs/07 6.5): two or more same-kind reports resolved by ONE revision merge into ONE escalation-decision entry with per-lineage `debits` rows and resolvedBy 'class'; a denied per-lineage debit degrades the group to single-target decisions so denial semantics stay per report. The folds already consumed this form; single-target behavior and all existing cassette bytes are unchanged.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: `termination:config-drift` now actually fires on resume when a live termination knob diverges from the journaled `termination.init` (the journal wins, the divergence is reported per field; docs/07 11.2). Events are never journaled, so frozen cassettes are unaffected.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: a `retry` escalation decision re-opens the node AND clears its stale dispatch handle; previously the re-opened node sat ready forever while the scheduler skipped it (the re-dispatch liveness gap behind Flavor B defaultDecision retry).
  - `@rulvar/plan`: `lesson_add` keys once (docs/07 9.2): a repeated add with the same content key acks the recorded lesson instead of appending a duplicate; re-executed-turn recovery is unchanged.
  - `@rulvar/core`: an extension dispatch whose agent dies BEFORE its root entry lands now surfaces the underlying failure loudly to the dispatching caller instead of hanging the dispatch await forever (the pre-root cousin of the stale-writer liveness rule). Healthy paths and replays are byte- and timing-identical.
  - Known residual, unchanged: repeated Flavor B suspensions on ONE re-opened node dedup onto the first suspension's decision key; the recorded cassettes route around it and the at-cap immediate-resolution flavor rows stay with M9-T04's later parts.

- ebe0abc: M9-T04 (part 2): the six DEF-5 catalog cassettes (docs/09 section 6.5; docs/03 section 9), plus the reuse-producer completions the rows forced.

  - Six new frozen cassettes with public runners and byte-for-byte replay tests: oscillation-full-reuse (escalated-terminal donor, shared full link, by-ref root, reclaimedUsdAtLink carries the donor spend), graft-partial-subtree (a three-rung limit ladder severed mid-top-rung grafts exclusively; the completed rung attempts forward-match through the scope alias and only the interrupted rung reruns live, exactly once), crash-between-link-and-root (cut strictly between the durable node.link and the by-ref root; the resume rolls forward with zero repayment), oscillation-guard-trip (the third re-add at maxOscillationsPerKey 2 rejects osc_guard with the embedded verdict and the run closes non-HITL), worktree-disposed-degrade (an unpinned worktree graft donor degrades to a fresh admit with DedupNote graft_unsafe; reuse_full stays allowed for a worktree donor with a terminal root), claim-exclusivity-and-chain (two identical adds in ONE revision: the first grafts exclusively, the second degrades donor_active; the severed grafted node becomes the chain head and the third add drains the chain transitively; oscillationCount reaches 2).
  - `@rulvar/core` (docs/03 9.3/9.6 producer completions, folds and bytes of existing journals unchanged): evaluateReuse now skips exclusively-claimed donors (first-wins) and degrades to a fresh admit with the documented `donor_active` reason when every candidate is captured; a severed grafted node inherits its captured link's chain (ancestry plus chain-tail graft eligibility), so the next add links to the chain head and drains transitively; agent dispatch roots record their resolved isolation (`value.isolation`, only when not 'none') so the DedupIndex worktree rules can read it from the journal.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: exclusive captures are first-wins WITHIN one revision too: the second identical add of the same revision degrades to `donor_active` instead of double-claiming the donor.
  - All fifteen M9 cassettes re-record byte-identically under the double-run agreement; the nine part-1 fixtures are untouched by the producer changes. fixtures.sha256 covers 50 frozen files.

- a3079d0: M9-T04 (part 3): the six DEF-8 catalog cassettes plus the DEF-7 reserve-survives-run-exhaustion row (docs/09 sections 6.7 and 6.8), with the roll-forward and reserve producers the rows exposed.

  - Seven new frozen cassettes with public runners and byte-for-byte replay tests: revise-racing-defaultDecision (the mandatory stale-wake trio dropping dep_already_resolved with blockingRef, node_escalated, node_already_done in ONE revision), crash-after-append-before-effects (the pre-effects kill point; both children spawn live exactly once on resume and the request-only cancel lands on the redispatched branch), amend-vs-running-then-cancel-add, intra-revision-self-conflict (sequential intra-revision semantics), bad-base-streak-terminates (three fabricated-base all-dropped entries then the non-HITL guards fallback), park-races-child-completion (parkRequested extinguished by the child-result transition, no park retention), and reserve-survives-run-exhaustion (adds that would invade the committed finalize reserve drop admission_denied inside the revision outcomes; the forced finish executes FROM the reserve and closes the run ok).
  - `@rulvar/plan`: the idempotent plan_revise recovery path now also re-lands request-only cancels and parks by aborting the redispatched mid-flight branch; previously the crash-after-append-before-effects roll-forward left the cancelled branch running forever.
  - `@rulvar/plan`: an accepted escalation resolution records the node's done reference (doneRefs), so a later waive_dep against the resolved dependency drops dep_already_resolved with the blockingRef pointing at the resolving reference, exactly like a child-result transition.
  - `@rulvar/core`: the forced finish now RELEASES the finalize reserve as it begins (releaseFinalizeReserve): the reserve stops subtracting from the admission remainder at the moment it is being spent, or the finalize agent could never draw the money reserved for it under a tight run ceiling. Admissions stay frozen past the cap, so nothing else can take it. Cap behavior under unlimited ceilings (all existing cassettes) is byte-identical.
  - All 22 M9 cassettes re-record byte-identically under the double-run agreement; fixtures.sha256 covers 57 frozen files.

### 0.9.0

#### Minor Changes

- f920013: M8-T03: the multi-process seam soak and the queue-failover-during-forced-finish cassette (the DEF-7 final cassette; docs/09 sections 6.9 and 6.10; docs/10 section 3.9 exit criteria).

  - `@rulvar/plan`: the public `runQueueFailoverDuringForcedFinish` cassette runner: worker A loses its lease strictly between the cap decision and the final wake; worker B reclaims with a bumped fencing epoch and rolls the forced finish forward. The stale writer's appends are rejected and invisible, exactly one cap decision exists, finalization is paid once. The LeasableStore is injected (`QueueFailoverDeps.makeStore`) so the package stays core-only; the replay test and the record script supply the reference SqliteStore.
  - `@rulvar/cli`: the multi-process-fencing-soak harness: two workers over one SqliteStore file with kill/failover across the suspension, plan-revision, and forced-finish boundaries; every round asserts zero split-brain and zero double pay. Worker hardening: a failed renew now frees the concurrency slot immediately (a stale run whose landings all reject may never settle; fencing, not the stale process's cooperation, protects the journal).
  - Repo: `cassettes/queue-failover-during-forced-finish.json` recorded and frozen (double-run agreement; `scripts/record-m8-cassettes.mjs`); the queue-mode limitation stays documented (no distributed cross-process rate limiter, EXC-14/OQ-17).

### 0.8.0

#### Minor Changes

- 85d55cf: The v0.8.0 BREAKING release notes (M7 adaptive orchestration full; the flagged BREAKING minor of the pre-1.0 convention, docs/12 registry).

  BREAKING: the unified `AdmitVerdict` union is extended with the reuse verdicts (`reuse_full`, `admit_graft`) and the new reject codes (`termination_exhausted`, `ladder_exceeds_frozen`, `lineage_exhausted`, `lineage_busy`, `osc_guard`) (DEF-5). How it fails: exhaustive switches over the verdict kind or reject code in custom shells and admission SPI extensions stop compiling. Migration: add branches for the new arms; reject-code switches should route unknown codes to their generic-denial path.

  BREAKING: reuse-by-reference is the DEFAULT (DEF-5). A byte-identical `add_task` after a cancel or abandon no longer re-executes the subtree: the result returns by reference (`reuse_full`) or continues from the paid prefix (`admit_graft`). How it fails: changed semantics; runs that relied on re-execution against a changed world observe referenced results instead. This is the only intentional change of visible semantics in the pre-1.0 line. Migration: set `reuse.enabled: false` on the admission config, or `fresh: true` on the specific `add_task`.

  BREAKING: the config key `maxEscalationsPerNode` is renamed to `maxEscalationsPerLogicalTask` (XF-10): escalations count per logical task across respawns via the lineage chain. How it fails: a typed `ConfigError` naming the new key rejects the old one. Migration: rename the key; the default stays 2.

  BREAKING: the plan-size-scaled revision budget option is removed without deprecation (DEF-2). `maxRevisionsPerRun` is an absolute, non-replenishable counter (default 32) debited by exactly 1 per journaled `plan_revise`; nothing increments it. How it fails: the removed option is rejected at config validation. Migration: size `maxRevisionsPerRun` directly.

  BREAKING: `plan_revise` result and error schemas widen (rebase outcomes, embedded admissions, `revisionUnitsRemaining`) and `WakeDigest` gains the MANDATORY `termination` field beside `planHash`, `budget`, and `reuse` (DEF-2/DEF-8). How it fails: schemaHash and toolsetHash of orchestrator scopes change, so VCR cassettes recorded over orchestrator turns invalidate. Migration: re-record affected cassettes; consumers of the digest type add the new mandatory blocks (all-zero outside PlanRunner).

  BREAKING: B0, the run budget ceiling, is immutable after start (DEF-2): no API, including HITL decisions, can top it up. How it fails: code that mutated the run budget mid-run or expected an HITL top-up hits a typed runtime error; overshoot stays bounded by one turn per in-flight agent. Migration: size the ceiling at start; use the orchestrator cap and the finalize reserve (DEF-7) for graceful degradation instead of top-ups.

  BREAKING: PlanRunner requires a resolvable orchestrator cap (DEF-7). `orchestratePlanned` with no run USD ceiling and no explicit `budget.capUsd`, or with `effectiveCap < finalizeReserve`, refuses to start with a typed `OrchestratorCapConfigError` before any LLM call. Migration: pass `budget: { capUsd }` (or run under a USD ceiling and rely on `capFraction`, default 0.2; up to 1.0 opts out explicitly with a telemetry warning).

- 712a28e: M7-T01: the plan scope substrate. `TaskPlan` as engine-owned typed data (docs/07 3.1): `PlanNode` with the exact canonical field list, the closed `PlanNodeStatus` machine with immutable terminal statuses (`done` is immutable by construction) enforced by `assertPlanTransition` raising the typed `PlanInvariantError`; pure derivations `depsSatisfied`, `recomputePlanReadiness` (dependency satisfaction is derived in the fold, never a record), and `wouldCreateDepCycle` for the rewire_deps atomicity rule. `planHash` (docs/07 3.4): sha256 over the RFC 8785 canonical projection of PlanState through the frozen hashVersion 2 deriver, nodes sorted by NodeId, deps sorted in the hash, plus the guard fold counters revisionCount and droppedRevisionStreak; `assertPlanHead` raises `PlanInvariantError` on a fold-head mismatch; golden hashes are frozen in tests. `PlanWriteLock` (docs/07 3.2, XF-07): the in-process FIFO mutex serializing ONLY plan-scope appends, never a substitute for the ResolutionArbiter. The single sequential scope constant `PLAN_SCOPE` is `'plan'`. The temporary `M0_SCAFFOLD` marker is removed now that the package's first real API has landed.
- c8d88e7: M7-T04: plan.revision, plan.decision, and the committed rebase algorithm (DEF-8). `task-spec.ts`: the typed `TaskSpec`/`TaskSpecPatch` of docs/07 4.1 with `promptSpecHashOf` and patch application. `plan-entries.ts`: the two plan-mutating entry payloads (`PlanRevisionValue` with base/requestedOps/outcomes/assignedNodeIds/admissions/planHash chain/rationale plus the DEF-2 extensions; `PlanDecisionValue` with the closed `EnginePlanOp` set), content keys per docs/07 3.3 (rationale never keys), and THE single applier `applyPlanEntry`: replay consumes recorded outcomes (the APPLIED diff), never re-runs rebase, verifies the planHash chain under each entry's own hashVersion and raises the typed `ReplayPlanHashMismatch` at the exact entry; bad_base entries leave the hashed state byte-identical while lengthening the guard-side streak (`effectiveDroppedStreak`); terminal set_node_status transitions extinguish pending park/cancel flags and record doneRefs for waive blockingRef. `rebase.ts`: the committed algorithm (base validation against the recorded WakeDigest pair, conflicts evaluated ONLY against the fold head, sequential intra-revision application, per-op applied | transformed | dropped with the complete closed conflict table and reason codes, engine-computed cancel cascades excluding done, embedded add/unpark admissions, lineage-at-head checks, the DEF-5 dedup transform hook, and the DEF-7 plan_frozen row). Every row of the conflict table is exercised by the table-driven test matrix; the revise-racing-defaultDecision cassette shape asserts the exact dropped trio with blockingRef.
- a41c20f: M7-T05: PlanRunner scheduling and toolset. Core gains the PUBLIC orchestrator extension seam (docs/02 section 4 seam-sufficiency: orchestration packages build exclusively from the public API): `OrchestrateOptions.extension` hosts an `OrchestratorExtension` with boot strictly before the orchestrator's first agent entry, extension tools appended to the mode (c) toolset, an activity hook running after every child settlement strictly before wake evaluation, quiescence participation (nothing running AND nothing ready), digest extras, wake observation, prompt lines, and an `OrchestratorExtensionIO` exposing total-order appends into extension-owned scopes, the journal snapshot, the single admission point, explicit-scope child dispatch through the ordinary ctx.agent path (plan/NodeId sub-accounts open beside the orchestrator account), settled lookups, cancel, ULID minting, and telemetry. `outputSchemaRef`/`toolsetRef` now RESOLVE against the new `defaults.schemas` and `defaults.toolsets` engine registries (unknown names stay typed tool errors); `TerminationAccount.bindDeniedWriter` binds I/O onto fold-rebuilt accounts. @rulvar/plan ships `planRunner(options)` and `orchestratePlanned(engine, goal, opts)`: boot writes `termination.init` (frozen limits with kMax and the profile-registry snapshot hash) strictly before the first scheduling entry and binds the account into admission; plan_view renders the pinned pure fold (plan state, per-node LineageStats, the TerminationAccount snapshot) at the last delivered WakeDigest, with digestSeq 0 seeded as the empty-plan bootstrap snapshot; plan_revise (normative docs/07 4.7 schema) debits one revisionUnit per journaled revision (underflow writes termination.denied first), evaluates the committed rebase at the fold head, appends ONE plan.revision strictly before effects, schedules newly-ready nodes under plan/NodeId scopes, lands cancel requests, re-issues idempotently on re-executed turns (roll-forward), and emits plan:revised plus termination:debit; the engine (never the model) schedules ready nodes and journals ready-to-running and terminal transitions as plan.decision entries whose terminal transitions extinguish pending flags; quiescence completes (nothing running and nothing ready). The end-to-end revise-mid-run shape and a full crash-resume with zero live calls and no duplicate entries are covered by integration tests against the public engine API.
- 51b062a: M7-T06: RevisionGuards, the oscillation detector, and hysteresis (docs/07 3.8). New `guards.ts`: the non-HITL terminating guard state machine whose every verdict is a journaled decision entry (decisionType 'guard-verdict') written strictly BEFORE its effects, with replay rebuilding state from journaled verdicts. The droppedRevisionStreak detector consumes `effectiveDroppedStreak` (the hashed counter plus trailing bad_base entries) and fires the configured fallback (reject-revision | finish-with-partial | fail-run; default finish-with-partial, droppedRevisionLimit default 3) exactly once: further plan_revise calls are rejected with a typed tool error instructing a finish with the partial result, and the fourth revision after a three-bad-base streak journals nothing and debits nothing. The oscillation detector keys on approachSigCoarse ACROSS LogicalTaskId boundaries: a re-add after a severing cancel counts one oscillation, the per-key limit (2, the Appendix A osc_guard default) freezes the signature with a journaled verdict plus a guard:oscillation event, and frozen re-adds reject at admission with the embedded osc_guard verdict (dropped admission_denied in the revision entry); guard counters are fed from the plan fold itself, identically live and on replay, so freeze thresholds never shift across a resume (fired-but-unjournaled verdicts roll forward at boot, deduplicated by content key). Stall detection emits stall:detected per (lineage, streak) with the hard per-run stall replan cap journaling its own verdict; hysteresis stays structural (park/cancel against running nodes land only as boundary flags, so nearly-done children are never killed mid-turn). plan_view now renders the guards block (engaged fallback, frozen signatures, stall replans used).
- f4e70be: M7-T07: reuse-by-reference (DEF-5). Core: new `journal/reuse.ts` with the rich `DonorRef` (replacing the M6 seq placeholder inside the closed AdmitVerdict union), `GraftBoot`, `DedupNote`, `ReuseConfig`, `NodeLinkValue` and its content identity (`nodeLinkKey` over {kind, spawnKey, donorScope, targetNodeId}), the `DedupIndex` pure fold (severed roots become donor candidates when their pre-abandon effective status is not error, memoized failures excluded, exclusive claims resolve first-wins, plan-node scopes sweep their own branch payments, unpinned worktree donors degrade), `evaluateReuse` with the four-outcome verdict table (reuse_full | admit_graft | fresh-with-note | reject osc_guard at the link count), and the abandoned-spend ledger fold (abandonedUsd/reclaimedUsd/netLostUsd, per-key oscillation counts). The kernel matcher gains scope-prefix aliasing (docs/03 9.5): `registerAlias` merges donor-scope candidates into the target scope in journal order at every nested level, and the alias disposition bypasses the abandon overlay so donor entries regain their pre-abandon status ONLY through the alias (the standalone old scope stays skipped); a dangling donor root through the alias IS the graft frontier (rerun-dangling continues from the donor checkpoint). `AbandonAttempt` carries logicalTaskId (XF-04); the extension IO gains `abandonBranch`, `registerAlias`, and `priceUsd`. Plan: PlanRunner wires the DedupIndex at the fold head under the PlanWriteLock into the rebase dedup hook (transforms embed the verdict, the donor descriptor, and the placement into the revision entry), applies the per-SpawnKey osc_guard rejection, attaches DedupNotes to fresh admits, compiles applied cancel_task (and cancel-landed) into severing abandon entries with lineage attribution, lands node.link entries and by-ref roots in the mandatory write order with idempotent roll-forward, registers aliases (rebuilt by fold at boot), completes full-linked nodes by reference through an engine decision instead of a dispatch, debits a spawnUnit per reuse link, and renders the abandoned-spend view in plan_view (pinned) and the WakeDigest extras; `PlanRunnerOptions.reuse` carries the docs/03 9.9 config.
- 75d1646: M7-T08: park and unpark. Core: the internal boot-checkpoint channel lets a FRESH dispatch boot from a retained transcript checkpoint (`ExtensionDispatchSpec.bootCheckpointRef`; dangling redispatch checkpoints take precedence), serving park/unpark continuation and the DEF-5 graft boot. Plan: new `park.ts` with the `PinLedger` fold (live pins counted from abandon entries carrying retainWorktree, park pinning and DEF-5 retention SHARE `maxPinnedWorktrees`, default 4), `parkDispositionOf` (checkpoints always retained; worktrees pinned only under capacity, overflow keeps the checkpoint but drops the tree), and `unparkPlacementOf` (continuation from the retained checkpoint; restart when no checkpoint exists or a worktree-isolated node lost its tree: silent resume against a fresh tree is impossible). PlanRunner lands parks at the turn boundary: a park-requested running child is aborted, the `park-landed` plan.decision transitions running to parked carrying the checkpoint anchor (set_node_status gains the optional checkpointRef field, applied by the fold), the branch is severed with retainCheckpoint plus retainWorktree per the pin disposition, the dispatch slot frees for the unpark, and node:parked emits. unpark_task applies with the embedded admission: a previously dispatched branch is a lineage rebirth (relation 'unpark-restart' continuing the node's LTID), while a never-started parked node resumes scheduling without consuming an attempt; the unparked dispatch boots from `checkpointRefFor(runId, anchor)` on the continuation path and restarts otherwise. The park-unpark integration test drives the full shape deterministically (one paid tool turn, park inside the second turn, unpark continuation whose booted history carries the paid turn) plus the pin-cap overflow and placement rows as units.
- 5ed23d5: M7-T09: RunLedger (docs/07, section 9). New `ledger.ts`: the CLOSED authored op vocabulary (`brief_set` once per run, `fact_add`/`fact_supersede`, `lesson_add` keyed by (logicalTaskId, approachSig), `observation_add`), `foldLedger` as a pure fold of `ledger.op` entries joined to the journal task table (auto-derived revisionHistory, taskDigests, worldDelta; journal-vs-ledger contradictions render as flagged discrepancies, never as truth), single-writer discipline (foreign-scope ops ignored and flagged), Appendix A section caps (64 facts, 32 lessons, 16 observations) via `ledgerCapViolation`, compaction sufficiency via `ledgerSufficiency`, and the draft-versioned `exportLedger` (`ledgerExportVersion: 'draft-1'`). PlanRunner gains `ledger_append` and `ledger_read`: appends are journaled effect entries of kind `ledger.op` in the orchestrator scope with content-derived keys, idempotent on re-execution (a journaled op acks with the recorded ref and skips validation, so re-executed turns never spuriously reject); a `lesson_add` whose key matches no journaled attempt of that logical task rejects as a typed tool error; `ledger_read` is pinned to the delivered-wake seq exactly like `plan_view`, so a re-executed wake turn renders byte-identical ledger bytes and fold-global counters never enter the transcript.
- 0627413: M7-T10: ModelLadder full (docs/07 section 10; docs/04 section 12; FR-119/FR-313). Core: ladders now RESOLVE through the chain (`canonicalizeLadder` validates the declaration once, FR-119 undeclared-judge-rung ConfigError included, and resolves every rung's effort explicitly; `ladderRungChoice` yields the concrete per-rung ModelChoice; a higher concrete layer shadows a lower ladder and vice versa; a ladder that WINS wire resolution stays a typed ConfigError since rung attempts always carry a concrete override). `ladderLengthOf` reads the normative declaration points (profile `model: { ladder }` or the loop-role routing entry). `foldTermination` debits the rung RESPAWN's embedded admission on raising ladder verdicts (docs/07 11.3 b). New per-engine mechanical gate registry `defaults.gates` (`MechanicalGateProfile` over AgentResult.artifacts). The extension seam gains `io.random` (journaled ctx.random for spot-checks), `io.gates`, and dispatch fields `model` (the concrete rung resolution entering the attempt's identity hash), `memoizeOutcome`, and inline `schema` for the engine-synthesized judge. Plan: new `ladder.ts` plus the PlanRunner ladder driver: rung attempts are ordinary agent scopes on the concrete rung model with rung caps binding (tier N+1 = new content key = one live attempt, all sharing the LTID via relation `rung-retry` registered from the raising verdict's `nextAttempt`); triggers classify typed (error, limit, schema-exhausted, no-progress first-class via the abort class, verify-failed from gates only); acceptance gates run per ok attempt in declaration order with journaled `gate-verdict` decisions (mechanical registry profiles, judge on a declared rung >= the executing rung or explicit override with a forced verdict schema and derived identity, spot-check selection strictly via the journaled draw); every ladder verdict is a decision entry computed once live and recovered by content key, so folds consume only journaled values; a denied respawn writes `termination.denied` strictly before the fallback lands; an ok attempt whose acceptance fails with no raise left lands `failed`, never `done`. Mid-flight resume redispatches running nodes through forward matching (dangling attempts continue, settled ones replay instantly): the half-escalated-ladder shape resumes without repaying completed rungs, proven by the truncated-journal test.
- 55c0f87: M7-T11: EscalationProtocol completion (docs/07 section 6; DEF-2/3/4). Core: Flavor B now REQUIRES an explicit `deadlineMs` (the knob has no engine default per the frozen Appendix A row; a flavor B spawn without it is a typed ConfigError before any LLM call); SpawnRecord captures the dispatch's escalation flavor and the WakeDigest escalations block reports it (a flavor B report reaching the digest is already decided by the DEF-4 winner). Plan: new `escalation.ts` with the authoritative `escalation-decision` entry contract (decide-once per report by content key; `countsAgainstLimit` derived from the report kind, XF-06; the counting debit atomic with the append embedding `escalationUnitsAfter`; a DENIED debit writes `termination.denied` strictly before and flips the entry to `capExceeded` with `countsAgainstLimit: false`, so the cap yields the flagged decision plus the final report, never a bare limit, and the folds stay replay-strict). PlanRunner completes the decision flow: the `cancel_task` revision transform on an escalated node lands the verdict `cancel` decision, the `resolve_escalation` plan.decision (origin `escalation-live`), and the severing abandon strictly after the revision append; a settled Flavor B suspension's DEF-4 winner (timeout `defaultDecision` by `timeout`, a live decision, or a class fan-out) is absorbed into the authoritative entry (origins `escalation-default`/`escalation-class`) and the fate applies through the single applier (retry re-opens the node in place with the journaled `amendedPrompt`/`startTier` honored at re-dispatch, accept closes the paid partial result done, cancel closes cancelled, decompose leaves the node escalated while the proposed children enter through `spawn_admitted` ops with FRESH lineages and embedded admissions debiting spawn units through the decision entry).
- fd33871: M7-T12: orchestrator cap and finalize reserve (DEF-7; docs/07 section 12). BREAKING for PlanRunner runs (v0.8.0 registry, docs/12): `orchestratePlanned` now REQUIRES a resolvable orchestrator cap; a run with no USD ceiling and no explicit `budget.capUsd`, or with `effectiveCap < finalizeReserve`, refuses to start with a typed `OrchestratorCapConfigError` BEFORE the first LLM call and before any journal entries (an uncapped orchestrator was precisely the defect; `capFraction` up to 1.0 opts out explicitly). `effectiveCapUsd = min(capUsd, capFraction x runCeiling)`, default fraction 0.2. The engine writes ONE `orchestrator_budget_reserve` decision entry strictly after `termination.init` and strictly before the orchestrator's first agent entry, freezing the cap and the finalize reserve (explicit, or `finalizeTurns` x the deterministic per-turn estimate) in absolute dollars, recovered by content key on resume and never re-evaluated. The reserve registers on the orchestrator account AND the run root (kept separate from committedReserve; the admission block checks add it), so no spawn ever eats the finalization money. At the pre-wake soft boundary (`orchSpent + turnEstimate > effectiveCap - finalizeReserve`) the engine writes exactly ONE `orchestrator_budget_cap` decision strictly before any effects (an in-flight latch closes the wake-ordinal race): the plan freezes for adaptation but not for work (the rebase context `frozen` flag drops every op `plan_frozen` while admitted nodes run to completion), all wake triggers except quiescence disarm, and the orchestrator unwinds to the reserved FINAL wake: a fresh agent entry on the restricted single-`finish` toolset with a `finalizeTurns` limit, paid from the reserve; success yields outcome `ok` with `forcedFinish` marked in the CostReport. If the final finish fails, `orchestrator_finalize_fallback` journals and the engine SYNTHESIZES a deterministic partial result by pure fold with zero LLM calls; the run ends `exhausted` with the non-null partial (`RunOutcome.value` now survives exhaustion). Every digest carries the `WakeBudgetBlock` (run and orchestrator spend, cap, reserve, the epsilon-floored orchestrator share, `softWarning` at 0.8) with `orchestrator:budget` telemetry at each wake boundary and at the cap; `CostReport.orchestrator` populates spentUsd, wakes, forcedFinish, and reserveUsedUsd for H-OrchShare.
- e70e7f4: M7-T13: the FINAL normative WakeDigest in ONE coordinated schema change (docs/07 section 5; XF-08/XF-12, inside the frozen hashVersion-2 identity rules). `WakeDigest` now declares every block first-class: `digestSeq`, `planHash` (emission-time plan hash, empty outside PlanRunner), `coversToOrdinal`, `completedDigests` ordered by spawn ordinal, `escalations` (with the Flavor B `deadlineAt`), the MANDATORY `termination` snapshot (DEF-2, contributed by the PlanRunner extension as a pure fold), the MANDATORY `budget` block (`WakeBudgetBlock`, DEF-7), and the `reuse` stats (the AbandonedSpendView shape, DEF-5). Runs without the PlanRunner extension ship all-zero blocks (`emptyDigestBlocks`), mirroring the CostReport convention. The digest render is bounded deterministically: the new `renderBudgetChars` option clamps each TaskDigest `outputSummary` by CHARACTERS (the model-independent interim measure; the tokenizer choice stays the docs/14 open question, the numeric default TBD before M10). Pinning semantics are unchanged: the digest is part of the wake snapshot and a re-executed turn reads identical bytes.
- bc9c903: M7-T14: the M7 gating cassettes and the remaining metric wiring (docs/09 sections "Metrics" and "Mandatory defect cassette catalog"). Thirteen frozen cassettes record the round-2 set (revise-mid-run, crash-during-revision, park-unpark, oscillation-freeze, half-escalated-ladder, budget-denied-rung), the DEF-7 set minus queue-failover (cap-freeze-then-finish, crash-between-cap-and-effects, finalize-fallback-synthesized, escalation-storm-frozen), and representative DEF-2/DEF-3 rows (revision-exhaustion, rung-retry-lineage, decompose-mints-children), each double-run at record time and replayed byte-for-byte in CI through the new public `@rulvar/plan` cassette runners with deterministic journal normalization (ULIDs, content hashes, wall clock, spans, and refs collapse to first-appearance placeholders). Metric events: `orchestrator:woke` now carries `planHash`, `coversToOrdinal`, and `renderSize` (the deterministic character measure of the delivered digest, the wake-render-size metric); the escalated landing emits `escalation:raised` with the report kind, the lineage attribution, `agentType` (the escalation-rate slice), and `costToDateUsd`; the abandoned/reclaimed/netLost USD view rides every digest through the T13 reuse block and `ledger:op` plus `spawn:*` events already feed ledger-ops-per-spawn.

### 0.7.0

#### Minor Changes

- dc1c182: M6-T01: compileScript and the CompiledWorkflow surface. `compileScript(source, { allowImports })` validates planner-generated source (syntax over the exact sandbox global set; import/require/export scanning with a literal-specifier allowlist defaulting to none) and compiles it into the core `CompiledWorkflow` data form (errorPolicy 'lenient'); any violation throws the typed `ScriptRejected` carrying machine-readable `ScriptDiagnostic[]` for the plan() self-repair loop. Exports `SANDBOX_GLOBALS` (the docs/06 8.2 curated list) and `scriptDiagnosticsOf`. The closure Workflow and CompiledWorkflow forms stay mutually unassignable by type.
- fd1d06c: M6-T02: WorkerSandboxRunner and the sandbox contract. `@rulvar/planner` gains `WorkerSandboxRunner` (accepts CompiledWorkflow ONLY; worker_threads with the exact curated 12-global scope; timeoutMs 300000 / memoryMb 512 breaches terminate the worker with the new typed `SandboxError`, code `sandbox_limit`). Core gains the public host half, `createSandboxBridge`: proxied primitives (agent, step, workflow, awaitExternal, parallel, pipeline, phase, budget) served against the canonical run ctx with worker thunks executing under host-allocated scope tokens; the worker's SYNC seeded now/random/uuid (and the Date.now/Math.random replacements) mirror-journal as ordinary kind `rand` entries with match-first resume semantics; a busy-state protocol keeps suspension and quiescence behavior identical to in-process runs. `createEngine` gains `runners.sandbox`; `engine.run`/`engine.resume` accept CompiledWorkflow, persist the source blob plus workflowSourceRef/workflowHash at start, and `resume(runId)` with no workflow rehydrates the hash-pinned source (a differing supplied source is a typed ConfigError). New `FileTranscriptStore` makes compiled runs resumable across processes. The sandbox dialect exposes async `budget.spent()/remaining()`; import/fetch/process are absent from the worker scope.
- 6fcf296: M6-T04: profileCard and the API card. Core gains `profileCard(profiles)`: the one agent vocabulary both orchestration modes speak, feeding the planner prompt (mode b) and spawn_agent agentType guidance (mode c) with IDENTICAL text; pure function of the registry, sorted, byte-stable, rendering only model-agnostic fields (name, description, tool names, taskClass, estCost, escalation opt-in; models are never named). The planner gains `apiCard()`: the byte-stable card teaching exactly the curated 12-global sandbox dialect (schema literals only, tools by profile name, onError throw|null, async budget, no imports, the opts.key repeat rule) with usage patterns distilled from the examples corpus.
- dcc97a9: M6-T05: the plan agent and the self-repair loop (mode b). `plan(engine, goal, { model?, profiles?, repairRounds? })` asks a planner model under role `plan` to write a script against the API card plus the engine's profile card, lints it (eslint-plugin-rulvar preset + compileScript), self-repairs up to repairRounds (default 3) from the machine-readable JSON diagnostics, and returns `{ source, workflow, lint }`. The planner conversation is an ordinary journaled run with a goal-derived deterministic runId, so re-planning the same goal replays the unchanged prefix free; exhausting the rounds throws a typed ScriptRejected carrying the last diagnostics. `runPlanned(engine, goal, args?)` composes plan-then-sandbox-run (async by amendment). Core gains `AgentOpts.role` (`'loop' | 'plan' | 'orchestrate'`, the primary invocation role threading through resolution, effort defaults, floors, cost buckets, and events) and the narrow `Engine.profileCard(names?)` accessor rendering the registered profiles through the public API.
- 10b45f1: M6-T11: the rulvar plan command and the M6 gating cassettes. `rulvar plan "<goal>" [--dry-run]` (the canonical grammar) loads @rulvar/planner DYNAMICALLY (the CLI's static dependency stays @rulvar/core; a missing install is a clear error), plans against the host-config engine, prints the accepted script plus its advisory diagnostics, and runs it in the worker sandbox unless --dry-run. The three docs/09 6.10 gating cassettes are recorded on the FakeAdapter and committed under the frozen-fixture lock with exported scenario builders shared by the recorder script and the replay tests: sandbox-determinism (two fresh runs of one CompiledWorkflow produce byte-identical normalized journals matching the cassette), planner-self-repair (the failing draft round-trips through the JSON-diagnostics repair, re-planning from the committed journal is free, and the accepted script executes deterministically in the sandbox), and orchestrator-crash-resume (the committed pre-crash journal plus boundary checkpoints resume with zero re-paid spawns, no duplicate spawn decisions, and byte-stable handles).

### 0.6.0

#### Minor Changes

- fa05007: M5-T01 workflow registry and the @rulvar/cli base.

  - `@rulvar/core` gains the per-engine `WorkflowRegistry` type and
    `defaults.workflows` on createEngine (docs/06 section 10.4): an
    explicit first-class value, no module-level registry; shells resolve
    by-name runs against it (ctx.workflow's string form arrives M6, the
    queue worker M8).
  - Spec-conformance fix: the M4-T09 quality floors option moves from the
    createEngine top level to its canonical home `defaults.roleFloors`
    (docs/06 section 10.1). Update `createEngine({ floors })` call sites
    to `createEngine({ defaults: { roleFloors } })`.
  - `@rulvar/cli` ships its first real surface: the canonical grammar
    `rulvar run <file|name> [--args JSON] [--store PATH] [--budget-usd N]`,
    `rulvar resume <runId> [--args JSON] [--store PATH]`,
    `rulvar runs ls [--store PATH]`, `rulvar inspect &lt;runId&gt; [--store
PATH]` (no aliases), a line-oriented TUI progress renderer over the
    event stream, and interactive resolution of suspended approvals and
    externals (EOF leaves the run suspended, never errors). Engine
    assembly follows the host-config convention: `rulvar.config.mjs`
    default-exports `{ engineOptions?, workflows? }`, a workflow module
    may export `workflow`/`engineOptions`/`workflows`, and --store selects
    the JsonlFileStore directory (default `.rulvar`), so the CLI itself
    depends only on @rulvar/core. The `rulvar` bin is included; the
    resume/inspect grammar amendment (--args re-supply, --store symmetry)
    is recorded in docs/06 section 10.5.

### 0.5.0

#### Minor Changes

- b840aba: M4-T08 canonical effort completion and M4-T09 role quality floors.

  - Effort semantics are complete: the role effort defaults and the
    per-adapter mapping tables (Anthropic passthrough including max,
    OpenAI max downmapped to xhigh and recorded in providerMetadata,
    provider none only via namespaced providerOptions) shipped earlier
    milestones; this change completes VISIBLE scrubbing everywhere it was
    still silent: the summarize invocation surfaces its scrubs at fire
    time and a failover takeover surfaces the fallback's scrubs the
    moment it starts serving. Scrubbed effort is never mapped into
    max_tokens.
  - The effort-defaults-shift cassette is now RECORDED through the live
    runtime (docs/10 M4 gating row): the frozen v1 prefix, closed offline
    the way an operator would, resumes live under explicit high effort
    with the completed semantics; every v1 entry matches and the one new
    spawn carries canonical effort in v2 identity. The recorder output is
    pinned byte-for-byte by the frozen-drift suite and the fixture lock
    now covers 18 files.
  - Quality floors (`model/floors.ts`, M4-T09): per-role and
    per-declared-taskClass allow/deny lists supplied via
    `createEngine({ floors })`, enforced INSIDE the router at resolution,
    before any live call and before any journal entry, for every
    invocation the chain produces (primaries, failover fallbacks, and the
    summarize fallback alike). `AgentProfile.taskClass` declares the
    class; unclassified profiles see only byRole floors. A violation is a
    typed ConfigError.
  - The umbrella `rulvar` package now ships floors opinions next to its
    strong routing defaults: `recommendedDefaults.floors` pins orchestrate
    and plan to strong named models. The core itself ships no named model
    strings, and the umbrella suite enforces that with a source scan.

### 0.2.0

#### Minor Changes

- c24228d: M1-T10/T11: the WorkflowEvent envelope and M1 catalog (per-run telemetry
  seq distinct from JournalEntry.seq, span hierarchy run > phase > agent),
  the per-run EventBus feeding RunHandle.events and on(), RunOutcome with
  exhausted-overrides-error precedence and the normative CostReport
  (byModel/byPhase/byAgentType/byRole, the all-zero orchestrator block,
  unpriced evidence); createEngine with per-engine registries and
  engine.run over the ScriptRunner seam; InProcessRunner with the dev-mode
  bare-Date.now/Math.random warnings; run cancellation (host signal,
  handle.cancel, run deadline) and RunMeta run-to-definition binding
  fields. The umbrella ships the minimal terminal progress renderer
  (renderProgress) and re-exports the core surface.
- 5c4fc32: M1-T14/T15: @rulvar/testing tier 1 (FakeAdapter matching on
  agentType/label/prompt regex with a '*' fallback, honoring the selected
  structured-output tier, zero USD by construction; createTestEngine over
  the full real engine with recorded event streams; toHaveCalledAgent and
  toStayUnderBudget matchers at '@rulvar/testing/matchers') and the
  completed umbrella (re-exports of @rulvar/core and both first-class
  adapters, renderProgress, the umbrella-only recommendedDefaults strong
  model slots, the M1 exit-criteria example workflow, and the CI install
  smoke on packed tarballs). The core now populates the reserved
  providerOptions 'rulvar' telemetry namespace on every request (docs/04
  section 1.8 as amended) and AgentResult carries errorMessage detail for
  journaled WireError fidelity.

  monorepo scaffold on the committed toolchain (pnpm 11 workspaces with
  catalogs, TypeScript 6.0, tsdown, Vitest 4, ESLint 9 flat config,
  Turborepo 2, changesets fixed mode, npm trusted publishing), the docs/
  canon as single source of truth, the L0 contracts skeleton in @rulvar/core,
  and the vendored dependencies (StandardSchemaV1/StandardJSONSchemaV1 types,
  the @cfworker/json-schema lineage validator subset, a first-party monotonic
  ULID). Placeholder scaffolds only: no public API ships in this release.

## @rulvar/store-conformance

### 1.4.0

#### Minor Changes

- c4f563d: Production readiness fixes from the July 2026 full audit.

  - The `budgetUsd` ceiling now survives resume: the engine records it in `RunMeta.budgetUsd` and restores it on every resume, so the replayed spend counts against the original invocation's bound and `ResumeOptions` still exposes no way to raise it. Journals written before the field existed (or read through a store that drops optional `RunMeta` fields) resume uncapped, exactly as before; the conformance kit gains a round-trip check so custom stores cannot drop the field silently.
  - `spawn:rejected` and `resolution:applied` / `resolution:superseded` are now emitted: live admission rejections carry the rejection `code`, `agentType`, and the journaled decision `entryRef` (absent only for pre-admission config gates), and live resolution attempts report winning or losing the first-closing-wins fold. `spawn:admitted` now carries the decision `entryRef` and the admitting `verdict` arm. The `orchestrator:budget` union member now types the two payload shapes actually emitted; `journal:compat` stays declared but unemitted (the scan runs before a run's event stream exists) and its TSDoc says so.
  - `toOtel` implements real parent-child span nesting when `contextApi` and `setSpan` are passed; without them spans stay flat but attributed.

  - `'readonly'` isolation now compiles a deny rule for tools declaring risk `write` or `destructive` into the spawn's permission chain, exactly as the tools guide documents; read tools and other isolation modes are unaffected.
  - VCR `replay()` refuses a cassette recorded outside the engine's hashVersion support window (`[CURRENT-1, CURRENT]`) with a typed `ConfigError` instead of silently drifting; in-window cassettes replay as before.
  - `InMemoryStore` accepts `{ quiet: true }` to opt out of the durability warning, and the warning text now states the precise truth: nothing survives a process exit and cross-process resume is impossible (same-process resume of a kept instance works). `createTestEngine` constructs its store quietly, so the blessed offline tier no longer prints a misleading warning.
  - The bare `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` development warnings no longer blame workflow code for calls that originate in library internals (the engine's own retry jitter, provider SDKs): the retry jitter uses a natively captured `Math.random`, and the in-process guard skips callers that live under `node_modules`.
  - `rulvar run --profile` now applies the profile's per-role effort hints: entries in `defaults.routing` that carry no effort are seeded from `RunProfile.effortByRole` (an explicit host effort always wins; ladder entries and unrouted roles stay untouched).
  - `rulvar --help` documents the shipped `kb inbox` and `kb gate` subcommands.
  - The unscoped `rulvar` pointer package ships TypeScript declarations (`index.d.ts` with a `types` export condition), so strict TypeScript projects can import the bare name; the install smoke gate now packs and checks the pointer alongside the umbrella.

#### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c4f563d]
  - @rulvar/core@1.4.0

### 1.3.2

#### Patch Changes

- ddef383: Every published package now ships a README, so its npm page states what the package is, how it installs, and where the documentation lives (npm includes README.md in the tarball regardless of the files allowlist, so no manifest changes are involved; @rulvar/compat gains its README on its own next release). Alongside, the repository-level pages are refreshed to the current project state: the root README is rewritten around the never-pay-twice pitch with a runnable quickstart condensation and the full package table, CONTRIBUTING.md lists the complete PR gate set, the examples README drops retired-spec citations for live docs.rulvar.com links and documents the dogfood journal replay, and the pointer README gets the same treatment.
- Updated dependencies [ddef383]
  - @rulvar/core@1.3.2

### 1.3.1

#### Patch Changes

- 7d1552e: Runtime message strings no longer cite the retired internal specification set: error and warning messages, validation issues, and the CLI help text drop the dangling `docs/NN, section ...` references, pointing at https://docs.rulvar.com pages where a pointer earns its place (the CLI help header, tool naming, toolset registries, bare resume). The umbrella package description sheds the naming-contingency note: the unscoped alias is published and owned. Three strings embedded in frozen recordings stay byte-identical on purpose (the no-progress abort reason and two testing-internal recorder strings), as does the byte-locked golden-fold fixture. Test-file comments lose their citations too; test titles are unchanged.

Comment-only change: no runtime behavior, no API shapes, and no runtime message strings were modified; the frozen golden-fold fixture is byte-identical.

### 1.0.0

#### Minor Changes

- 5f0fdcd: M9-T03: community adapter and store guides (docs/10 section 3.10; docs/11 M9 exit row "conformance kits published as community guides").

  - New informative docs: `docs/guide-adapter-authors.md` (wire mapping requirements, the Usage invariant checklist, caps posture, an adapter skeleton template, and the VCR-based contract-test pattern with record and hermetic replay legs) and `docs/guide-store-authors.md` (the storage contracts A1-A4 plus leasing and fencing, a complete minimal LeasableStore walkthrough with an injectable clock and release-surviving epochs, conformance kit wiring, common failure modes, and publishing checklists). Both are indexed in the docs README inventory.
  - @rulvar/store-conformance gains the dogfood suite: the guide's CommunityMemoryStore walkthrough listing runs VERBATIM through journalStoreConformance and leasableStoreConformance in CI, so the acceptance ("a third-party mock store built only from the guide passes conformance") holds permanently and the guide's code cannot rot.

### 0.3.0

#### Minor Changes

- 43444f6: M2-T11/T12: the executable store conformance kit and the M2 gating
  cassettes with frozen fixtures.

  @rulvar/store-conformance ships its first real API: journalStoreConformance
  (A1 append atomicity, A2 total per-run order, A3 read-your-writes, A4
  opaque payload with read-side-only normalization, meta separation, the
  golden fold-state fixture with a frozen reference hash, the decide-once
  oracle, and the abandon-derived-skip fixture) and leasableStoreConformance
  (typed LeaseHeldError on held acquire, monotonic fencing epochs,
  stale-epoch appends rejected and invisible, released leases fenced from
  renew and append, optional ttl/renew-cadence timing checks), plus
  registerConformance for Vitest/Jest and the stableStringify fold-state
  hasher. InMemoryStore and JsonlFileStore pass; deliberately broken stores
  (reordering, normalizing, tearing, fencing-less) fail loudly.

  @rulvar/core kernel closes three DEF-1/DEF-4 gaps the cassettes gate: an
  abandon-covered hanging dispatch derives skipped instead of redispatching,
  abandon-covered operations contribute a zero ledger increment, the resume
  report lists covered entries as skipped (never orphaned), and an abandon
  over an already-resolved suspension folds to a noop with already_resolved
  (first-closing-wins per target, both closer kinds).

  @rulvar/testing ships the M2 cassette suite over committed frozen
  fixtures: the DEF-1 synthetic subset (abandon-subtree, memoize-classifier,
  v1-journal-on-v2), the DEF-4 set (timeout-vs-live-race,
  class-decision-fanout, abandon-then-crash-then-resume,
  abandon-vs-resolution-race, offline-invalid-then-valid,
  double-abandon-idempotent), the DEF-6 six IDs (resume-v1-on-engine-v2,
  resume-v1-with-inserted-call, suspended-v1-resolves-on-v2,
  reject-version-too-old via deriverV0Synthetic, reject-version-from-future,
  effort-defaults-shift), the mandatory mixed-version scenarios
  (ordinal-space split, forward-cursor preference, cross-version
  resolution, the compatibility and never-pay-twice-through-upgrade
  lemmas), and KeyDeriver contract tests against the frozen v2 golden
  identities including the docs/03 worked example. Fixture regeneration is
  deliberate: scripts/record-m2-cassettes.mjs rebuilds, and CI write
  protection (scripts/check-frozen-fixtures.mjs plus fixtures.sha256)
  fails any fixture diff shipped without the explicit bump token (the
  hyphenated compound of hashVersion and bump) in a changeset.

- 8f7e61f: M5-T02 SqliteStore: the first real surface of @rulvar/store-sqlite.

  epochs over the builtin node:sqlite driver (zero native dependencies;
  requires a Node.js line with node:sqlite unflagged, 22.13+/23.4+). It
  passes the full @rulvar/store-conformance suites: A1-A4 store
  obligations, meta separation, the golden fold fixture, the decide-once
  oracle, the abandon-derived skip, lease exclusivity (typed
  LeaseHeldError), monotonic fencing epochs with stale-append rejection
  and invisibility, release fencing, and wall-clock ttl expiry with the
  renew-at-ttl/3 cadence. The lease ttl defaults to the Appendix A interim
  reference for this store (60000 ms; the committed value is an M8
  decision), and an injectable clock supports expiry tests. This is the
  reference implementation for community stores (docs/03, section 12.6).

### 1.4.0

#### Minor Changes

- c4f563d: Production readiness fixes from the July 2026 full audit.

  - The `budgetUsd` ceiling now survives resume: the engine records it in `RunMeta.budgetUsd` and restores it on every resume, so the replayed spend counts against the original invocation's bound and `ResumeOptions` still exposes no way to raise it. Journals written before the field existed (or read through a store that drops optional `RunMeta` fields) resume uncapped, exactly as before; the conformance kit gains a round-trip check so custom stores cannot drop the field silently.
  - `spawn:rejected` and `resolution:applied` / `resolution:superseded` are now emitted: live admission rejections carry the rejection `code`, `agentType`, and the journaled decision `entryRef` (absent only for pre-admission config gates), and live resolution attempts report winning or losing the first-closing-wins fold. `spawn:admitted` now carries the decision `entryRef` and the admitting `verdict` arm. The `orchestrator:budget` union member now types the two payload shapes actually emitted; `journal:compat` stays declared but unemitted (the scan runs before a run's event stream exists) and its TSDoc says so.
  - `toOtel` implements real parent-child span nesting when `contextApi` and `setSpan` are passed; without them spans stay flat but attributed.

  - `'readonly'` isolation now compiles a deny rule for tools declaring risk `write` or `destructive` into the spawn's permission chain, exactly as the tools guide documents; read tools and other isolation modes are unaffected.
  - VCR `replay()` refuses a cassette recorded outside the engine's hashVersion support window (`[CURRENT-1, CURRENT]`) with a typed `ConfigError` instead of silently drifting; in-window cassettes replay as before.
  - `InMemoryStore` accepts `{ quiet: true }` to opt out of the durability warning, and the warning text now states the precise truth: nothing survives a process exit and cross-process resume is impossible (same-process resume of a kept instance works). `createTestEngine` constructs its store quietly, so the blessed offline tier no longer prints a misleading warning.
  - The bare `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` development warnings no longer blame workflow code for calls that originate in library internals (the engine's own retry jitter, provider SDKs): the retry jitter uses a natively captured `Math.random`, and the in-process guard skips callers that live under `node_modules`.
  - `rulvar run --profile` now applies the profile's per-role effort hints: entries in `defaults.routing` that carry no effort are seeded from `RunProfile.effortByRole` (an explicit host effort always wins; ladder entries and unrouted roles stay untouched).
  - `rulvar --help` documents the shipped `kb inbox` and `kb gate` subcommands.
  - The unscoped `rulvar` pointer package ships TypeScript declarations (`index.d.ts` with a `types` export condition), so strict TypeScript projects can import the bare name; the install smoke gate now packs and checks the pointer alongside the umbrella.

#### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c4f563d]
  - @rulvar/core@1.4.0

### 1.3.2

#### Patch Changes

- ddef383: Every published package now ships a README, so its npm page states what the package is, how it installs, and where the documentation lives (npm includes README.md in the tarball regardless of the files allowlist, so no manifest changes are involved; @rulvar/compat gains its README on its own next release). Alongside, the repository-level pages are refreshed to the current project state: the root README is rewritten around the never-pay-twice pitch with a runnable quickstart condensation and the full package table, CONTRIBUTING.md lists the complete PR gate set, the examples README drops retired-spec citations for live docs.rulvar.com links and documents the dogfood journal replay, and the pointer README gets the same treatment.
- Updated dependencies [ddef383]
  - @rulvar/core@1.3.2

### 1.3.1

#### Patch Changes

- 7d1552e: Runtime message strings no longer cite the retired internal specification set: error and warning messages, validation issues, and the CLI help text drop the dangling `docs/NN, section ...` references, pointing at https://docs.rulvar.com pages where a pointer earns its place (the CLI help header, tool naming, toolset registries, bare resume). The umbrella package description sheds the naming-contingency note: the unscoped alias is published and owned. Three strings embedded in frozen recordings stay byte-identical on purpose (the no-progress abort reason and two testing-internal recorder strings), as does the byte-locked golden-fold fixture. Test-file comments lose their citations too; test titles are unchanged.

#### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7d1a287]
  - @rulvar/core@1.3.0

### 1.2.0

#### Patch Changes

- 154507b: TSDoc and inline comments no longer cite the retired internal specification set (the pre-docs-site `docs/NN, section ...` references). The citations either became links to the public documentation at docs.rulvar.com or were dropped where the comment already carried the rule; traceability markers (DEF-n, XF-nn, FR-nnn, OQ-nn, W-nnn) are untouched. Comment-only change: no runtime behavior, no API shapes, and no runtime message strings were modified; the frozen golden-fold fixture is byte-identical.

#### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d16b04a]
  - @rulvar/core@1.1.0

### 1.0.0

#### Minor Changes

- 807d1f9: M9-T04 (final part): the DEF-4 live re-record, production-journal replay, and the one-CI-job catalog gate (docs/09 section 6; docs/10 M9 row "Complete catalog green in one CI run"; the 1.0 gate of docs/12 section 5).

  - The six DEF-4 cassettes are re-recorded through the LIVE producers per the synthetic-fixture rule: engine runs, RunHandle.resolveExternal, and the offline kernel writer (the M8 machinery) produce the committed journals; recordLiveCassettes gains the six recorders and scripts/record-m3-cassettes.mjs regenerates them. The synthetic builders stay in the suite as the kernel regression (def1-def4.test.ts now replays the builder output for DEF-4), and the new def4-live.test.ts replays the committed live forms end-to-end, seq-agnostic.
  - Production-journal replay is wired: dogfood journals live under the frozen `journals/` directory and every one replays STRICT with zero live calls against its shipped workflow (examples/src/journals.test.ts; RECORD_DOGFOOD=1 re-records). Seeded with judge-panel-fake, a full run of the shipped judge-panel example.
  - The catalog gates as ONE CI job: `cassette-catalog` runs scripts/catalog-audit.mjs (every docs/09 section 6 ID must resolve to a cassettes/ fixture or a named suite; 58 IDs today, parser-drift guarded) and then a single vitest invocation over every cassette suite (the M2/M3/M9 fixture suites, the M7/M8/M9 plan cassettes, the M8 multi-process soak, and the dogfood journals), replay-strict with zero live calls.

### 0.9.0

#### Minor Changes

- 65c7b2c: M8-T01: createServer, the HTTP shell (docs/02 section 8.2; FR-702), plus the Engine.stores seam it stands on (docs/06 10.2, M8 entry amendment).

  - `@rulvar/cli`: `createServer({ engine, workflows })` returns `{ fetch(req: Request): Promise<Response> }` with the five canonical routes: POST /runs (start a registered workflow), GET /runs/:id (status and outcome), GET /runs/:id/events (SSE; Last-Event-ID maps to the event seq, replay is at-least-once and consumers deduplicate on `replayed`), POST /runs/:id/external/:key (programmatic resolution, `by: 'external'`; a run that settled suspended in-process auto-resumes; a run not live in this process gets the documented offline append under a lease where the store is leasable, and resumes on a worker), GET /runs/:id/cost (the settled in-process CostReport, or the pure journal fold priced by the optional `priceUsd`). Authentication stays host middleware (docs/14, OQ-16).
  - `@rulvar/core`: the Engine interface gains the readonly `stores` accessor exposing the configured journal and transcript stores; exactly the instances createEngine received (or defaulted), no store contract widens.
  - `@rulvar/testing`: `createTestEngine` forwards the new `stores` accessor.

- ebc8101: M8-T04: the redaction and retention interim rules executed (docs/14 OQ-20 and OQ-22; docs/09 section 8 rewritten to the executed state; docs/03 12.4 and 12.8; docs/06 10.1 and 10.2 amendments).

  - `@rulvar/core`: the L0 SerializationHook (`createEngine({ serialization })`): redact/encrypt at the append/put boundaries, symmetric on load/get, applied by wrapping the stores so `Engine.stores` exposes the one policy point; kernel ordering fields are drift-checked with a loud ConfigError. Default key masking at the telemetry boundary: every emitted WorkflowEvent passes `maskSecrets` (provider keys, PATs, bearer tokens, JWTs, private-key blocks become `[masked-secret]`); opt out via `redaction: { maskEvents: false }`; never touches the journal. Retention: `TranscriptStore.delete(ref)` joins the SPI (missing ref is a no-op; InMemory and File stores implement it), `Engine.deleteRun(runId)` cascades blob deletion before the journal (no orphan transcripts), and `Engine.pruneRun(runId)` deletes checkpoint blobs of ok-terminal attempts that nothing else references (parked, cancelled, escalated, and hanging attempts keep theirs).
  - `@rulvar/cli`: `createServer` and `createWorker` take the opt-in `retention` predicate over RunMeta (the server applies it at terminal settles, the worker during sweeps under a brief lease); the OTel exporter masks string span attributes with the same policy, defense in depth over the already conservative attribute content policy.
  - `@rulvar/testing`: `createTestEngine` forwards `deleteRun`/`pruneRun`.

### 0.7.0

#### Minor Changes

- 10b45f1: M6-T11: the rulvar plan command and the M6 gating cassettes. `rulvar plan "<goal>" [--dry-run]` (the canonical grammar) loads @rulvar/planner DYNAMICALLY (the CLI's static dependency stays @rulvar/core; a missing install is a clear error), plans against the host-config engine, prints the accepted script plus its advisory diagnostics, and runs it in the worker sandbox unless --dry-run. The three docs/09 6.10 gating cassettes are recorded on the FakeAdapter and committed under the frozen-fixture lock with exported scenario builders shared by the recorder script and the replay tests: sandbox-determinism (two fresh runs of one CompiledWorkflow produce byte-identical normalized journals matching the cassette), planner-self-repair (the failing draft round-trips through the JSON-diagnostics repair, re-planning from the committed journal is free, and the accepted script executes deterministically in the sandbox), and orchestrator-crash-resume (the committed pre-crash journal plus boundary checkpoints resume with zero re-paid spawns, no duplicate spawn decisions, and byte-stable handles).

### 0.6.0

#### Minor Changes

- 638d9a1: M5-T04 VCR cassettes and cron contract tests. `@rulvar/testing` gains
  the tier-2 VCR at the adapter boundary: `record({ adapters, cassette,
redact? })` wraps live adapters and appends redacted JSONL rows keyed by
  a hash of the canonical wire-contract request (the engine-populated
  providerOptions.rulvar telemetry namespace is excluded from the key);
  `replay({ cassette, onMiss })` serves recorded streams back with the
  typed VcrMissError under 'throw' (hermetic CI) or live forwarding under
  'passthrough'. Redaction happens at record time: the built-in policy
  masks authorization material (key-shaped strings, bearer tokens,
  api-key assignments) in every stored string and a custom hook composes
  on top, so secrets never reach cassette bytes. Cassette headers record
  the hashVersion they were produced under (DEF-6), and replay adapters
  expose the recorded caps snapshots. The live contract-test cron
  workflow is now real: weekly, non-blocking, gated on the
  CONTRACT_TESTS_ENABLED variable and provider keys, validating the wire
  contract (one terminal event, Usage invariant, finish vocabulary)
  against committed provider cassettes and opening a contract-drift issue
  on failure instead of rerecording.

### 0.5.0

#### Minor Changes

- ac274f4: M4-T01 role protocol completion. The full trigger protocol for the six
  invocation roles lands in `@rulvar/core` (`model/roles.ts`):

  - Extract necessity is completed per docs/04 section 8.3: a separate
    final structured-output invocation fires when a schema is set AND
    (routing directs extract to a different model OR the loop model's
    required tier cannot ride a tools-available turn OR finalize is
    routed). The required-tier rule is new: a `forced-tool` tier pins
    toolChoice to `emit_result` and cannot ride while the agent's tools
    must remain available, so such agents now pay one separate extract
    call instead of silently losing tool access. Agents without tools
    keep the M1 single-shot behavior byte for byte.
  - The finalize role fires for the first time: only when configured in
    routing and only for tool-bearing agents, as one synthesis invocation
    with toolChoice `'none'` over the full transcript after tools stop.
    Its text is the output for schema-less calls; with a schema the
    separate extract runs over the transcript including the synthesis.
  - A separate extract invocation over a tool-bearing transcript now
    carries the agent's tool contracts (both providers reject tool-use
    history without tool definitions) with toolChoice pinned to `'none'`
    or to `emit_result` per tier.
  - Both adapters map `toolChoice: 'none'` to the provider's explicit
    none choice with the tools param present instead of dropping tools
    from the request.
  - `createTestEngine` no longer routes `finalize` by default: the
    routing key is the firing opt-in, and the old default would have
    summoned a synthesis call for every tool-bearing test agent. Tests
    that want finalize route it explicitly.

  Identity is untouched: extract and finalize resolutions never enter
  the spawn content key, and existing journals replay unchanged.

- b840aba: M4-T08 canonical effort completion and M4-T09 role quality floors.

  - Effort semantics are complete: the role effort defaults and the
    per-adapter mapping tables (Anthropic passthrough including max,
    OpenAI max downmapped to xhigh and recorded in providerMetadata,
    provider none only via namespaced providerOptions) shipped earlier
    milestones; this change completes VISIBLE scrubbing everywhere it was
    still silent: the summarize invocation surfaces its scrubs at fire
    time and a failover takeover surfaces the fallback's scrubs the
    moment it starts serving. Scrubbed effort is never mapped into
    max_tokens.
  - The effort-defaults-shift cassette is now RECORDED through the live
    runtime (docs/10 M4 gating row): the frozen v1 prefix, closed offline
    the way an operator would, resumes live under explicit high effort
    with the completed semantics; every v1 entry matches and the one new
    spawn carries canonical effort in v2 identity. The recorder output is
    pinned byte-for-byte by the frozen-drift suite and the fixture lock
    now covers 18 files.
  - Quality floors (`model/floors.ts`, M4-T09): per-role and
    per-declared-taskClass allow/deny lists supplied via
    `createEngine({ floors })`, enforced INSIDE the router at resolution,
    before any live call and before any journal entry, for every
    invocation the chain produces (primaries, failover fallbacks, and the
    summarize fallback alike). `AgentProfile.taskClass` declares the
    class; unclassified profiles see only byRole floors. A violation is a
    typed ConfigError.
  - The umbrella `rulvar` package now ships floors opinions next to its
    strong routing defaults: `recommendedDefaults.floors` pins orchestrate
    and plan to strong named models. The core itself ships no named model
    strings, and the umbrella suite enforces that with a source scan.

### 0.4.0

#### Minor Changes

- dfe03b5: M3-T11 gating cassettes and the v0.4.0 BREAKING release notes.

  BREAKING (pre-1.0 convention, docs/12): `AgentStatus` now produces
  `'escalated'` at runtime and `AgentResult` carries the optional
  `escalation: EscalationReport` field (present if and only if the status
  is escalated). This is the third kernel amendment of the replay
  predicate (escalated-replays-as-ok, DEF-1) whose table row shipped
  frozen in M2; the producers ship here. Migration: add an `escalated`
  branch to every switch over `AgentStatus`; consumers not adopting the
  protocol are advised to map `escalated` to `limit` (paid partial work,
  output null, the report stays available for logs). `isEscalated` and
  `EscalatedResult` are exported for narrowing. Status production stays
  gated by opt-in: workflows that never pass `escalation` options cannot
  observe the new status at runtime.

  Cassettes: the DEF-1 live set (escalate-replay,
  crash-between-report-and-decision, flavor-b-timeout) is recorded through
  the live runtime and replayed strict; the M2 synthetic DEF-1 subset is
  re-recorded (memoize-classifier fully live; abandon-subtree through the
  kernel write APIs with a realistic escalated child report and an
  authorizing owner cancel decision; both re-record again with the
  orchestrator producers in M7). FakeAdapter gains fakeToolCalls and
  fakeWireError responder markers; replayRun gains the onEscalation
  pass-through so replay tests can prove the hook stays cold. The
  deliberate fixture regeneration updates fixtures.sha256 in the same
  change (the identity profile is UNCHANGED; this is the docs/10 M3-T11
  ordered re-record, not an identity-pipeline revision).

### 0.3.0

#### Minor Changes

- 43444f6: M2-T11/T12: the executable store conformance kit and the M2 gating
  cassettes with frozen fixtures.

  @rulvar/store-conformance ships its first real API: journalStoreConformance
  (A1 append atomicity, A2 total per-run order, A3 read-your-writes, A4
  opaque payload with read-side-only normalization, meta separation, the
  golden fold-state fixture with a frozen reference hash, the decide-once
  oracle, and the abandon-derived-skip fixture) and leasableStoreConformance
  (typed LeaseHeldError on held acquire, monotonic fencing epochs,
  stale-epoch appends rejected and invisible, released leases fenced from
  renew and append, optional ttl/renew-cadence timing checks), plus
  registerConformance for Vitest/Jest and the stableStringify fold-state
  hasher. InMemoryStore and JsonlFileStore pass; deliberately broken stores
  (reordering, normalizing, tearing, fencing-less) fail loudly.

  @rulvar/core kernel closes three DEF-1/DEF-4 gaps the cassettes gate: an
  abandon-covered hanging dispatch derives skipped instead of redispatching,
  abandon-covered operations contribute a zero ledger increment, the resume
  report lists covered entries as skipped (never orphaned), and an abandon
  over an already-resolved suspension folds to a noop with already_resolved
  (first-closing-wins per target, both closer kinds).

  @rulvar/testing ships the M2 cassette suite over committed frozen
  fixtures: the DEF-1 synthetic subset (abandon-subtree, memoize-classifier,
  v1-journal-on-v2), the DEF-4 set (timeout-vs-live-race,
  class-decision-fanout, abandon-then-crash-then-resume,
  abandon-vs-resolution-race, offline-invalid-then-valid,
  double-abandon-idempotent), the DEF-6 six IDs (resume-v1-on-engine-v2,
  resume-v1-with-inserted-call, suspended-v1-resolves-on-v2,
  reject-version-too-old via deriverV0Synthetic, reject-version-from-future,
  effort-defaults-shift), the mandatory mixed-version scenarios
  (ordinal-space split, forward-cursor preference, cross-version
  resolution, the compatibility and never-pay-twice-through-upgrade
  lemmas), and KeyDeriver contract tests against the frozen v2 golden
  identities including the docs/03 worked example. Fixture regeneration is
  deliberate: scripts/record-m2-cassettes.mjs rebuilds, and CI write
  protection (scripts/check-frozen-fixtures.mjs plus fixtures.sha256)
  fails any fixture diff shipped without the explicit bump token (the
  hyphenated compound of hashVersion and bump) in a changeset.

- a1b35d3: M2-T09/T10: engine.resume under the run-to-definition binding contract
  (wf required for in-process runs, name mismatch is a typed ConfigError,
  body-hash mismatch warns loudly and proceeds; the compatibility scan
  runs strictly before any side effect; the resumed run seeds the budget
  from the ledger fold, re-emits open suspensions, and reports
  ResumePreview hits/misses/reruns/orphans plus invalid offline
  resolutions), the dryRun option (replay-strict matching: the first
  would-be-live call settles the run with the typed journal_miss error and
  zero live calls), and @rulvar/testing replayRun (tier 3: strict replay
  of any journal with JournalMissError on ANY live call; suspended
  journals finish suspended with zero live calls).

  the full real engine with recorded event streams; toHaveCalledAgent and
  toStayUnderBudget matchers at '@rulvar/testing/matchers') and the
  completed umbrella (re-exports of @rulvar/core and both first-class
  adapters, renderProgress, the umbrella-only recommendedDefaults strong
  model slots, the M1 exit-criteria example workflow, and the CI install
  smoke on packed tarballs). The core now populates the reserved
  providerOptions 'rulvar' telemetry namespace on every request (docs/04

  journaled WireError fidelity.
